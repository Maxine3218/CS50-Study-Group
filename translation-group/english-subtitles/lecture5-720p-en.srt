1
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,830
中文字幕
This is CS50.

2
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,920
中文字幕
And today, we transition from the world of C and, with it, pointers

3
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,010
中文字幕
and some of the struggles that you might have felt over the past few weeks

4
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,560
中文字幕
to a more familiar world, that of web programming.

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,740
中文字幕
I'm using web browsers and mobile devices and laptops and desktops

6
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,230
中文字幕
and creating more graphical and more interactive experience

7
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,760
中文字幕
than our traditional command-line terminals have allowed.

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,720
中文字幕
And we'll see, though, along the way that a lot of the ideas that we've

9
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,300
中文字幕
been exploring over the past few weeks are still going to remain with us.

10
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,210
中文字幕
And we're going to see them in different ways.

11
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,580
中文字幕
We're going to see them in the form of other languages and other syntax.

12
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,220
中文字幕
But the ideas will remain quite reminiscent of what

13
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,330
中文字幕
we did back in week 0.

14
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,950
中文字幕
So TCP/IP is perhaps the most technical way

15
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,380
中文字幕
and the most low-level way we can quickly make the web uninteresting.

16
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,600
中文字幕
But you've probably, at least, seen this acronym somewhere, maybe

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,900
中文字幕
on your Mac, your PC, some setting maybe once upon a time.

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,080
中文字幕
And this, actually, just refers to a protocol

19
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,050
中文字幕
or, really, a pair of protocols, languages of sorts

20
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,230
中文字幕
that computers speak in order to transmit information

21
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,900
中文字幕
from one computer to another.

22
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,040
中文字幕
And this is what makes most of the internet today work.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,250
中文字幕
The fact that you can pull up your laptop and desktop

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,210
中文字幕
and talk to any computer on the internet is because of these protocols,

25
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,870
中文字幕
conventions that humans decided shall exist some years ago.

26
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,350
中文字幕
And they just dictate how computers intercommunicate.

27
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,130
中文字幕
But let's make it a lot more familiar.

28
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,290
中文字幕
In our human world, you've probably, at some point, sent or received a letter.

29
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,090
中文字幕
These days, it's perhaps more electronic.

30
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,950
中文字幕
But, at least, you've gotten one such letter

31
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,590
中文字幕
from probably a human, maybe a grandparent or the liked,

32
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,180
中文字幕
or sent something yourself.

33
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,020
中文字幕
But before you can actually send that message to the recipient

34
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,040
中文字幕
and put it through the US mail or the international mail services,

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,790
中文字幕
what needs to go on the envelope?

36
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,540
中文字幕
Address.

37
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,490
中文字幕
Yeah-- so some kind of address.

38
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,290
中文字幕
And what does an address consist of?

39
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,960
中文字幕
Name.

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,130
中文字幕
Where they are.

41
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,640
中文字幕
So where they are might include a street address and a city,

42
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,070
中文字幕
a state, a ZIP code in the US, or a postal code, more generally,

43
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,240
中文字幕
and the country, if you really want to be specific.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,450
中文字幕
And so all of that goes on the front of the envelope,

45
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,590
中文字幕
generally in the center of the envelope.

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,370
中文字幕
And then what often goes on the top left-hand corner in most countries?

47
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,250
中文字幕
The return.

48
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,550
中文字幕
Yeah.

49
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,010
中文字幕
So the return address-- so that if something goes wrong,

50
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,280
中文字幕
albeit infrequently, that letter can get-- make its way back to you,

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
中文字幕
and also the recipient knows just immediately who actually sent them

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,270
中文字幕
the no.

53
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,120
中文字幕
So that is enough information to get a letter from point A

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,910
中文字幕
to point B because these addresses, these postal addresses

55
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,950
中文字幕
in our human world, uniquely identify houses or buildings or people,

56
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,870
中文字幕
in some sense, in the world.

57
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,030
中文字幕
So right now, we're at 45 Quincy Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02138, USA.

58
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,210
中文字幕
That is probably enough specificity for anyone in the world

59
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,660
中文字幕
to mail us a postcard saying "Hello world" in written form

60
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,980
中文字幕
and get it to this building.

61
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,640
中文字幕
Meanwhile, if we wanted to send something to the Science Center,

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,070
中文字幕
1 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Mass, 02138, USA, that's its unique address.

63
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,420
中文字幕
So it stands to reason that computers, including our own Macs and PCs

64
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,370
中文字幕
and Android phones and iPhones and the like,

65
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,700
中文字幕
all have unique addresses, as well, because, after all, they

66
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,540
中文字幕
want to communicate.

67
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,390
中文字幕
And they need to get bits, zeros and ones, from point A to point B.

68
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,290
中文字幕
But they're not quite as verbose as those kinds of addresses.

69
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,650
中文字幕
Computers have what you probably know as IP addresses,

70
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,600
中文字幕
Internet Protocol addresses.

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
中文字幕
And this just means that humans decided years ago

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,160
中文字幕
that every computer in the internet is going

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,690
中文字幕
to have a unique number identifying it.

74
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,530
中文字幕
And that number is generally of the form something dot something dot something

75
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,700
中文字幕
dot something.

76
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,200
中文字幕
And, as it turns out, each of these somethings between the dots

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,590
中文字幕
is a number from 0 to 255.

78
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,640
中文字幕
And now, after all these weeks of CS50, your mind

79
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,830
中文字幕
can probably jump to a quick answer.

80
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,060
中文字幕
How many bits must each of these numbers be taking up

81
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,430
中文字幕
if the range is from 0 to 255?

82
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,240
中文字幕
Eight.

83
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,830
中文字幕
So eight-- and why is that eight?

84
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,120
中文字幕
So 256 has been a recurring theme.

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,670
中文字幕
And if you don't recall, that's fine.

86
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,650
中文字幕
But yes, this is eight bits, eight bits, eight bits, eight bits,

87
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,210
中文字幕
which means the numbers that we humans use to uniquely identify our computers

88
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,350
中文字幕
on the internet are 32 bits in total.

89
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,190
中文字幕
Well, there's probably another number that can roughly come to mind.

90
00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:01,170
中文字幕
If you've got 32 bits, how high can you count, roughly speaking, from 0 to--

91
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,020
中文字幕
I heard a murmur--

92
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,180
中文字幕
Four billion.

93
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,460
中文字幕
So it's roughly four billion.

94
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,360
中文字幕
And we brought that up in week 0 with a four billion-page phone book,

95
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,050
中文字幕
imagining that.

96
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,290
中文字幕
So four billion is roughly what you can count up to with 32 bits.

97
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,120
中文字幕
So that means there can be four billion computers, devices, or anything

98
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,500
中文字幕
on the internet, uniquely identified-- small white

99
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,670
中文字幕
lie because that's actually not quite enough these days with all the devices

100
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,000
中文字幕
and all the humans in the world.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,540
中文字幕
But we found workarounds for that.

102
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,340
中文字幕
Question?

103
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,230
中文字幕
But only half of them at the time.

104
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,730
中文字幕
No.

105
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,540
中文字幕
So yes, if by 2023 or whatever year humans are projected

106
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,380
中文字幕
to be almost entirely online, and there's

107
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,670
中文字幕
some-- billions and billions of people, eight billion or so,

108
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,430
中文字幕
then that's a problem for this system.

109
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,950
中文字幕
Thankfully, as long ago as 20 years ago did people realized,

110
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,910
中文字幕
mathematically, this was going to be a problem.

111
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,970
中文字幕
And so there's actually a newer version of IP, Internet Protocol.

112
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,180
中文字幕
This is version 4 we're talking about, which is still

113
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,710
中文字幕
pretty omnipresent in the world.

114
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,570
中文字幕
Version 6 actually uses not 32 bits, but 128 bits, which is massive.

115
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,000
中文字幕
And I can't even pronounce how big of a number that is.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,130
中文字幕
So we're thinking about it.

117
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,250
中文字幕
And the biggest companies of the world have already

118
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,510
中文字幕
transitioned to using bigger addresses rather than these 32-bit addresses.

119
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,830
中文字幕
But these are still pretty common in almost any device you might own or see

120
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,610
中文字幕
on campus or elsewhere.

121
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,500
中文字幕
So if you have a unique address, that's enough to put

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,710
中文字幕
on the front of the envelope.

123
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,520
中文字幕
And it turns out that if you're sending an email or a chat message

124
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,890
中文字幕
or whatever, you, too-- your Mac, PC, or phone-- has an IP address.

125
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,570
中文字幕
So that's enough to put in the top left-hand corner, conceptually.

126
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,760
中文字幕
But you need one more piece of information.

127
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,040
中文字幕
It turns out that on the internet, there are servers, computers,

128
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,680
中文字幕
that are just constantly listening for people to connect

129
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,190
中文字幕
to them, like us, checking our email and visiting Facebook

130
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,320
中文字幕
and Gmail and other such websites.

131
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,480
中文字幕
And those servers, though, can do multiple things.

132
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,890
中文字幕
Google has lots of businesses.

133
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,220
中文字幕
They give you email and web services and video conferencing

134
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,590
中文字幕
and lots of other internet-based services.

135
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,070
中文字幕
And so humans also decided, years ago, to identify

136
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,880
中文字幕
all of these possible internet services with just unique numbers--

137
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,100
中文字幕
names also, but also unique numbers.

138
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,600
中文字幕
And it turns out that humans decided years ago

139
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,730
中文字幕
that when you visit a website, there's one more piece of information that's

140
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,520
中文字幕
got to go on this envelope, not just the server's IP address

141
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,100
中文字幕
that you're trying to connect to, but also the number 80

142
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,420
中文字幕
because 80 equals HTTP, acronym you're surely familiar with by now.

143
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,570
中文字幕
And that just denotes this is a web request.

144
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,860
中文字幕
If, instead, it said something like 25, that's SMTP, which is email.

145
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,260
中文字幕
So that might mean inside of this virtual envelope

146
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,810
中文字幕
is actually an email message going to Gmail or the like.

147
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,320
中文字幕
And there's bunches more numbers.

148
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,950
中文字幕
But the point is that there are numbers that uniquely identify.

149
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,880
中文字幕
So when Google gets a virtual envelope, just a whole bunch of bits, zeros

150
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,310
中文字幕
and ones, that, in some way, has an IP address on it as the destination,

151
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,970
中文字幕
it also knows, oh, is this an email or is this a video conference message

152
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,460
中文字幕
or is this a chat message or something else.

153
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,260
中文字幕
So just to make this more real then, if I'm

154
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,800
中文字幕
going to go ahead and write this down, my IP address to whom

155
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,640
中文字幕
I'm sending something might be 1.2.3.4.

156
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,520
中文字幕
Generally, then, I'm going to send it to, say, port 80.

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,470
中文字幕
Maybe my IP address is 5.6.7.8.

158
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,010
中文字幕
And so an envelope--

159
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,260
中文字幕
I'll be at ---- and it's really just going to have those pieces

160
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,720
中文字幕
of information-- the destination address, colon,

161
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,870
中文字幕
and then the number of the service you care about, HTTP or whatever,

162
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,460
中文字幕
and then your own IP address, and more information.

163
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,690
中文字幕
But the point is both sender and recipient in dresses--

164
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,800
中文字幕
that's enough to get data from one computer in the world to another.

165
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,300
中文字幕
And there's so much more complexity.

166
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,530
中文字幕
This is a whole field in computer science of networking,

167
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,820
中文字幕
if you like this kind of stuff.

168
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,170
中文字幕
But that's how, in a nutshell, the internet gets data from point A

169
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,420
中文字幕
to point B. And this envelope just represents

170
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,530
中文字幕
a whole bunch of zeros and ones.

171
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,020
中文字幕
But what's inside of that envelope?

172
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,810
中文字幕
And that's where we'll focus today and in the weeks to come.

173
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,120
中文字幕
It's actually content.

174
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,220
中文字幕
It's the email you care about or the web page you care about.

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,390
中文字幕
And how do we actually decide what server we're connecting to?

176
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,200
中文字幕
Well, typically, you might go to a so-called URL, Uniform Resource

177
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,180
中文字幕
Locator.

178
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,460
中文字幕
A URL is just the address of a server.

179
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,690
中文字幕
And that's going to be the-- really, the ultimate recipient of that envelope

180
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,040
中文字幕
that we're trying to send.

181
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,260
中文字幕
But this, of course, is not an IP address.

182
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,180
中文字幕
This does not follow the pattern something dot

183
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,830
中文字幕
something dot something dot something.

184
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,680
中文字幕
So if all of us humans are constantly typing stuff like this

185
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,320
中文字幕
into our browsers, yet the whole story just

186
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,970
中文字幕
told is about numbers and port numbers and low-level stuff,

187
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,260
中文字幕
where's the connection?

188
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,560
中文字幕
Does anyone already know how you get from typing this

189
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,370
中文字幕
to a bunch of zeros and ones that are somehow addressed with numbers?

190
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,000
中文字幕
DNS, I heard.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,360
中文字幕
What's DNS?

192
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,910
中文字幕
Yeah.

193
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,490
中文字幕
So it turns out there's a technology in the world-- domain name system,

194
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,180
中文字幕
in fact.

195
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,870
中文字幕
And DNS, Domain Name System, is just a type of service on the internet

196
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,790
中文字幕
that Harvard maintains and Yale maintains,

197
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,160
中文字幕
and Comcast and Verizon and a lot of the big players

198
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,410
中文字幕
in the world, whose purpose in life is to run

199
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,940
中文字幕
servers that convert what are called domain names to IP addresses,

200
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,980
中文字幕
and vice versa, so that when we humans type in www.example.com into a browser,

201
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,390
中文字幕
it's our Mac or PC or phone that contacts a local server, a DNS server,

202
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,780
中文字幕
on the local campus or university or apartment or whatever,

203
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,100
中文字幕
asks what is the IP address for www.example.com.

204
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,480
中文字幕
And then what your Mac or PC or phone does

205
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,060
中文字幕
is it writes that address on the envelope.

206
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,990
中文字幕
But it puts a request for specific web page inside of the envelope.

207
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,370
中文字幕
And when you get back a response from that server,

208
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,120
中文字幕
it's going to be your address that's on the front of the envelope.

209
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,820
中文字幕
And inside of the envelope is going to be

210
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,840
中文字幕
the web page or the email or the chat message

211
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,360
中文字幕
or whatever it is you were trying to actually access.

212
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,900
中文字幕
So let's tease this apart into some of its components.

213
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,030
中文字幕
First of all, this thing here highlighted in yellow

214
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,430
中文字幕
is officially the domain name.

215
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,180
中文字幕
You've probably all used this term before.

216
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,810
中文字幕
It's usually something dot something.

217
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,300
中文字幕
"Com" typically refers to commerce or commercial, although anyone,

218
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,760
中文字幕
for any purpose, can use .com.

219
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,520
中文字幕
Back in the day, very popular were .com, .net, .org, .edu, .gov, .mil.

220
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,650
中文字幕
And these were all very US-centric because it

221
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,050
中文字幕
tended to be the United States that really kicked off

222
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,330
中文字幕
this use of the internet and DNS.

223
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,440
中文字幕
But now it's certainly spread globally.

224
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,190
中文字幕
And so there's hundreds now of what are called TLDs, Top-Level Domains.

225
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,150
中文字幕
They tend to be three or more characters if they denote a word.

226
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,730
中文字幕
And they tend to be two characters if they denote a country,

227
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,150
中文字幕
like US is United States, JP is Japan, UK--

228
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,920
中文字幕
United Kingdom, and so forth.

229
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,500
中文字幕
Those are just country codes that do the same thing.

230
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,380
中文字幕
But what's this at the front?

231
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,760
中文字幕
Worldwide web, or www, here, more generally, is an example of what,

232
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,630
中文字幕
technically speaking?

233
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,210
中文字幕
What is this?

234
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,740
中文字幕
What does this mean?

235
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,260
中文字幕
Yeah?

236
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,020
中文字幕
Subdomain.

237
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,100
中文字幕
It's a subdomain-- is one way of thinking about it.

238
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,160
中文字幕
In fact, all of you, many of you here, probably

239
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,480
中文字幕
have email addresses of the form college.harvard.edu or g.harvard.edu

240
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,080
中文字幕
or the like.

241
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,070
中文字幕
Those are subdomains.

242
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,350
中文字幕
Harvard's such a big place that they actually

243
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,880
中文字幕
put everyone in different categories of domains, otherwise known as subdomains.

244
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,020
中文字幕
And that might be a word or a phrase that comes before the domain name here.

245
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,270
中文字幕
But it can also just mean the name of a server.

246
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,720
中文字幕
So if example.com is the company or business whose website you're trying

247
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,910
中文字幕
to visit, their domain is example.com.

248
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,130
中文字幕
And they bought that domain name some years ago.

249
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,460
中文字幕
And they spent a few dollars every year, probably, renewing the fee for that.

250
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,200
中文字幕
And they have at least one server whose name is www.

251
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,920
中文字幕
And that exists within their domain.

252
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,510
中文字幕
They might have dozens or hundreds or just one server.

253
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,890
中文字幕
Each of them can have a name.

254
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,800
中文字幕
So this is generally called the hostname.

255
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,410
中文字幕
So when it's an email address, it often implies a subdomain,

256
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,360
中文字幕
like a category of addresses.

257
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,140
中文字幕
But when it's in a URL like this, it means probably a specific machine

258
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,660
中文字幕
or a specific set of machines-- conventionally,

259
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,670
中文字幕
the web servers that the company runs--

260
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,080
中文字幕
doesn't have to be called www.

261
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,820
中文字幕
For historical purposes, MIT tends to use web.mit.edu.

262
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,600
中文字幕
But almost everyone else in the world uses www or nothing at all.

263
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,690
中文字幕
It's not required.

264
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,240
中文字幕
You can actually just visit many websites without visiting any hostname.

265
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,420
中文字幕
And it just works, as well, thanks to DNS giving you the IP address.

266
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,710
中文字幕
But what about the file you're actually requesting?

267
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,590
中文字幕
What does it actually mean to visit this URL?

268
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,970
中文字幕
Well, on many servers, this implicitly means, hey, web server,

269
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,970
中文字幕
give me a file, just a text file, called index.html.

270
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,090
中文字幕
That's the name of the file, a text file,

271
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,420
中文字幕
that you could create with CS50 IDE or even Notepad or TextEdit

272
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,640
中文字幕
on your own Mac or PC that contains a language called HTML.

273
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,850
中文字幕
And we'll take a look at that language in just a bit.

274
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,600
中文字幕
And some of you might have seen it before.

275
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,650
中文字幕
But the language in which web pages are written is HTML.

276
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,530
中文字幕
And we'll give you the building blocks, conceptually and practically,

277
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,390
中文字幕
for that today.

278
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,020
中文字幕
You'll use it over the coming weeks in many different contexts.

279
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,250
中文字幕
But we'll use it, ultimately, to create the contents of websites.

280
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,760
中文字幕
But today, we'll focus first on this, HTTP.

281
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,430
中文字幕
Anyone know what that stands for?

282
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,930
中文字幕
Yeah?

283
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,870
中文字幕
HyperText.

284
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,740
中文字幕
Yeah.

285
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,060
中文字幕
HyperText Transfer Protocol.

286
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,770
中文字幕
And honestly, in most of technology, it's

287
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,130
中文字幕
not so much what the acronyms represent that's all that important,

288
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,720
中文字幕
but, really, what the technology does.

289
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,160
中文字幕
And in this case, HyperText Transfer Protocol--

290
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,580
中文字幕
we'll see hypertext in a moment.

291
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,860
中文字幕
That's another way of saying HTML.

292
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,530
中文字幕
Transfer Protocol-- P for Protocol-- that's another buzzword.

293
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,440
中文字幕
So protocols are not programming languages, per se.

294
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
中文字幕
They are conventions.

295
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,340
中文字幕
And we humans have conventions, too.

296
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,800
中文字幕
For instance, if I were to meet someone for the first time,

297
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,640
中文字幕
I probably wouldn't stand on stage and lean down like this to do it.

298
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,940
中文字幕
But I might say, hi, I'm David.

299
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,220
中文字幕
Hi.

300
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,510
中文字幕
I'm Stephan.

301
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,810
中文字幕
Stephan, nice to meet you.

302
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,130
中文字幕
And we have this weird handshake that was aborted prematurely there--

303
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,070
中文字幕
that we have this weird convention-- us humans, at least in the US,

304
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,780
中文字幕
of greeting someone with a handshake.

305
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,230
中文字幕
And Stephan just knew to do that, however awkwardly.

306
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,110
中文字幕
And then he disengaged because the transaction was complete.

307
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,990
中文字幕
And that's not unlike what a web server does.

308
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,960
中文字幕
When you request a web page, you're sending a request to someone

309
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,520
中文字幕
as though you're extending your hand.

310
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,270
中文字幕
You're expecting something in return.

311
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,970
中文字幕
But in the case of a computer, of course,

312
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,540
中文字幕
it's like the web page itself coming back in an envelope from point B

313
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,160
中文字幕
to point A.

314
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,370
中文字幕
So that's what a protocol is.

315
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,200
中文字幕
We just have been programmed to know what

316
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,320
中文字幕
to do when we want to request a greeting or information

317
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,700
中文字幕
and get something back in return.

318
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,020
中文字幕
It's like a client-server relationship in a restaurant.

319
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,340
中文字幕
A customer requests something off the menu.

320
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,280
中文字幕
The server, the waiter or waitress, brings it to them

321
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,200
中文字幕
and, thus, completes that transaction as well.

322
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,780
中文字幕
And that's what the internet is, too--

323
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,250
中文字幕
clients and servers, browsers and servers, computers

324
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,010
中文字幕
and other computers, ultimately.

325
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,130
中文字幕
So with that relationship in mind, let's take a look

326
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,790
中文字幕
at what's actually inside of this envelope.

327
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,000
中文字幕
In the case of Stephan's and my greeting, it was more visual.

328
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,090
中文字幕
But in the case of a computer, it's going to be more textual, literally.

329
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,000
中文字幕
So inside of the envelope the, virtual envelopes,

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,430
中文字幕
so to speak, that your browser sends to a server

331
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,890
中文字幕
when trying to request a web page, is actually

332
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,660
中文字幕
a message that looks like this.

333
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,480
中文字幕
Thankfully, it's not terribly cryptic, although the dot, dot, dot

334
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
中文字幕
implies there's more contents inside of the envelope.

335
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,440
中文字幕
But the keyword here literally is gets, a verb.

336
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,490
中文字幕
And there's other verbs that the browser can use.

337
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,340
中文字幕
And this one literally means, get me the following home page.

338
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,790
中文字幕
What home page you want to get?

339
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,710
中文字幕
Well, the default one.

340
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,790
中文字幕
This forward slash, as it's called, just represents the default web page

341
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,930
中文字幕
on a website.

342
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:18,490
中文字幕
And in many cases, that implicitly means an actual file called index.html, just

343
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,040
中文字幕
a convention.

344
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,210
中文字幕
It can be called other things and not exist at all.

345
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,390
中文字幕
But in many cases, that means, implicitly,

346
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,230
中文字幕
get me a file called index.html.

347
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,190
中文字幕
And we'll see what that looks like in a moment.

348
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,820
中文字幕
Http/1.1 just means, hey, Stephan, I speak HTTP version 1.1.

349
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,380
中文字幕
Hopefully, you do as well.

350
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,410
中文字幕
There can be other and newer and older versions of the same thing.

351
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,200
中文字幕
Notice down here, though-- whoops-- notice now here, though,

352
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,810
中文字幕
that the hostname is also in this envelope

353
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,740
中文字幕
because it turns out that web servers can do multiple things at once.

354
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,690
中文字幕
And they can serve multiple domains.

355
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,750
中文字幕
You don't need your own personal unique server to serve a website.

356
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,270
中文字幕
You can have tens, hundreds, thousands of different websites

357
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,230
中文字幕
all on the same server.

358
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,100
中文字幕
And if any of you ever paid for your own domain name or your own personal home

359
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,830
中文字幕
page or the like, you are probably paying someone

360
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,550
中文字幕
for shared space on one server or more servers,

361
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,800
中文字幕
not for your own personal dedicated one.

362
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,890
中文字幕
But again, this might implicitly mean the same thing as this.

363
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,260
中文字幕
Give me index.html.

364
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,780
中文字幕
So what is it that actually comes back from the server?

365
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,080
中文字幕
The server, hopefully, responds with a message that looks like this.

366
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,310
中文字幕
It responds with confirmation of the version of the protocol it speaks.

367
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,100
中文字幕
That's like Stephan saying, yes, I speak HTTP 1.1 as well.

368
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,380
中文字幕
200 is a numeric code that signifies literally OK.

369
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,250
中文字幕
All is well.

370
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,360
中文字幕
I understood you.

371
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,080
中文字幕
Here is the information you requested.

372
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,640
中文字幕
And Content-Type, below it, is a more technical way of saying,

373
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,210
中文字幕
the type of content I'm handing back to you in my own envelope

374
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,150
中文字幕
from point B to point A, or from Stephan to me,

375
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,910
中文字幕
is in a language called HTML that happens to be text.

376
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,040
中文字幕
Why does it look like this?

377
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,770
中文字幕
Humans, years ago, just decided that this

378
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,270
中文字幕
would be the sequence of characters that computers literally

379
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,070
中文字幕
send to communicate that information.

380
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,470
中文字幕
So let's actually try this in one case, maybe, for instance, with harvard.edu,

381
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,320
中文字幕
and see what actually happens to see what else we might see.

382
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,640
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and open up Chrome, or any browser,

383
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,610
中文字幕
for that matter, that supports some kind of debugging and diagnostics.

384
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,730
中文字幕
And I'm going to do this.

385
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,830
中文字幕
And you can access this in different places.

386
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,080
中文字幕
I'm going to go up to View, Developer, and View Developer Tools.

387
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,790
中文字幕
This is something that comes with Chrome.

388
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,760
中文字幕
You sometimes have to enable it in Safari and other browsers.

389
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,760
中文字幕
But almost every browser these days has this capability.

390
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,430
中文字幕
And you'll notice that this just opened up a whole bunch of tabs

391
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,440
中文字幕
at the bottom of my screen here that I'm going

392
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,060
中文字幕
to be able to use to actually explore what is--

393
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,190
中文字幕
did I kick something else?

394
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,730
中文字幕
Apologies.

395
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,920
中文字幕
It's back-- won't step on there.

396
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,670
中文字幕
So what is this going to allow us to do?

397
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,510
中文字幕
Well, notice there's a lot of features here.

398
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,920
中文字幕
It's overwhelming at first glance.

399
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,440
中文字幕
But there's a tab here called Network.

400
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,690
中文字幕
And it turns out that one of the features Chrome gives to developers,

401
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,840
中文字幕
which you now all are-- is software developers--

402
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,350
中文字幕
is the ability to see what's going on underneath the hood of a browser,

403
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,160
中文字幕
to see what is inside of these virtual envelopes

404
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,950
中文字幕
that your browser has all those years been sending

405
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,730
中文字幕
from itself to servers elsewhere.

406
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,280
中文字幕
So I'm going to go ahead and do this.

407
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,630
中文字幕
I'm going to go ahead and actually visit http://harvard.edu and hit Enter.

408
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,550
中文字幕
And you'll see a whole bunch of stuff happens,

409
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,070
中文字幕
including the web page appearing at the top of the screen.

410
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,200
中文字幕
I'm going to ignore all of this stuff at the bottom

411
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,020
中文字幕
except for the very, very first request.

412
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,750
中文字幕
If I zoom in on this, notice that highlighted in blue

413
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,450
中文字幕
here is the very first request, harvard.edu.

414
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,790
中文字幕
And if I click on that, I'm going to see a little more information at right.

415
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,540
中文字幕
And if I go scroll down to what are called

416
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,290
中文字幕
request headers, the lines of text that were inside the message

417
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,320
中文字幕
that my browser sent, this is literally what

418
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,650
中文字幕
my browser sent inside the envelope, unbeknownst to me,

419
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,580
中文字幕
when I visited harvard.edu.

420
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,010
中文字幕
Thankfully, it confirms my prediction earlier, get/http/1.1,

421
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,290
中文字幕
because I requested harvard.edu's home page.

422
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,470
中文字幕
Host is harvard.edu.

423
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,310
中文字幕
Then there's the dot, dot, dot, the stuff that we don't particularly

424
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,570
中文字幕
care about today.

425
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,030
中文字幕
But let me go ahead and look at the response.

426
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,100
中文字幕
So this was my request.

427
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,160
中文字幕
This was my hand going out to Stephan.

428
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,250
中文字幕
Let's see what his or the server's response

429
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,880
中文字幕
is by scrolling up to this, which is called response headers.

430
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,150
中文字幕
Harvard's server, fortunately, does speak the same protocol

431
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,730
中文字幕
as me, 1.1 of HTTP.

432
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,910
中文字幕
But apparently, Harvard moved permanently.

433
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,260
中文字幕
What does that mean?

434
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,440
中文字幕
I went to http://harvard.edu, not there.

435
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,050
中文字幕
Where is it?

436
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,930
中文字幕
Well, there's a little more information here.

437
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,600
中文字幕
There's a lot of dot, dot, dot, things we don't care about.

438
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,110
中文字幕
But if we focus on one that-- oh, location--

439
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,870
中文字幕
where is Harvard now, apparently?

440
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,880
中文字幕
Yeah, say--

441
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,480
中文字幕
Yeah.

442
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,750
中文字幕
It looks like Harvard "moved" permanently from http://harvard.edu to,

443
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:11,830
中文字幕
and let me highlight it, https://www.harvard.edu,

444
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,240
中文字幕
with two notable changes.

445
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,040
中文字幕
One, there's the www.

446
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,420
中文字幕
And two, there's also what that might catch your eye?

447
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,880
中文字幕
S, which most of you probably know these days means secure,

448
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,610
中文字幕
and which implies encryption in the spirit of Caesar and Vigenere,

449
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,810
中文字幕
but much more secure than those simple ciphers.

450
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,440
中文字幕
The information is somehow scrambled now when I'm communicating

451
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,350
中文字幕
between myself and harvard.edu.

452
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,650
中文字幕
So there's two decisions there.

453
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,490
中文字幕
Harvard has decided that they want to allow and, indeed, require

454
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,700
中文字幕
users to visit their website securely so that no one--

455
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,800
中文字幕
no company, no government, no family members--

456
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,000
中文字幕
can necessarily see what is being requested of Harvard's website

457
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,090
中文字幕
because that is scrambled information, much like using something

458
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,680
中文字幕
like Caesar or Vigenere.

459
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,470
中文字幕
And Harvard also, probably for branding reasons,

460
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,410
中文字幕
but also partly for technical reasons, decided,

461
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,570
中文字幕
we want you to think of our website as www.harvard.edu.

462
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,010
中文字幕
And it's a mix of marketing and technical for a few different reasons,

463
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,810
中文字幕
one of which is www we humans just all know means website.

464
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,610
中文字幕
And if you see harvard.edu--

465
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,050
中文字幕
this is less true these days--

466
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,130
中文字幕
might not necessarily imply as obviously that this is a websites URL.

467
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,120
中文字幕
Frankly, not too many years ago, even advertisements and TV ads and printed

468
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,220
中文字幕
ads and the like would even show http:// to really make clear to viewers that

469
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,160
中文字幕
this is a web address.

470
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,580
中文字幕
But gradually, as more and more people get on the internet

471
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,070
中文字幕
and understand technology and URLs and the like,

472
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,820
中文字幕
we can just start dropping the stuff that is unnecessary clutter because all

473
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,950
中文字幕
of us now know intuitively, oh, harvard.edu-- it's

474
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,800
中文字幕
probably a web address that I can just type into a browser.

475
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,190
中文字幕
And the browser or the server will finish my thought for me

476
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,600
中文字幕
and actually prepend the secure URL or the www or the like.

477
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,810
中文字幕
So we still haven't actually found Harvard, it seems.

478
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,220
中文字幕
So let's do this instead.

479
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,280
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and zoom out and visit a different URL.

480
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,150
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and, again, go to View, Developer, Developer

481
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,490
中文字幕
Tools, Network Tab.

482
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,290
中文字幕
And now let me visit that more verbose URL, more precise URL, and hit Enter.

483
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,300
中文字幕
Again, a whole bunch of stuff gets requested--

484
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,130
中文字幕
more on that some other time.

485
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,770
中文字幕
But now, if I click on the first such request

486
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,710
中文字幕
and look at my response headers, you'll actually

487
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:20,260
中文字幕
see, albeit in a different format now, that the status of this request is 200,

488
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,270
中文字幕
which, recall, meant--

489
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,980
中文字幕
OK.

490
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,100
中文字幕
So now these are two numbers that, honestly, you've

491
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,320
中文字幕
probably not really seen or cared all that much about, 200 and 301.

492
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,040
中文字幕
But odds are you've seen at least one other number when visiting URLs.

493
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,610
中文字幕
For instance, besides actually seeing 200 and 301, you've probably seen 404.

494
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,890
中文字幕
Now, it apparently refers to Not Found.

495
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,090
中文字幕
But more in real terms, what does that mean?

496
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,670
中文字幕
How do you induce that error?

497
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,100
中文字幕
The site doesn't exist.

498
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,180
中文字幕
You mistyped a URL.

499
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,370
中文字幕
The web page doesn't exist.

500
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,770
中文字幕
A system administrator just changed the name on something or it's an old URL.

501
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,310
中文字幕
Any number of reasons can mean that the file was not found.

502
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,150
中文字幕
That file might have been index.html or any other URL.

503
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,050
中文字幕
But all this time when you visited a website and you've seen 404,

504
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,890
中文字幕
it's not clear, frankly, why servers have been bothering to tell us 404.

505
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,010
中文字幕
Most people don't need that level of information.

506
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,640
中文字幕
But it derives from that HTTP response, that first line

507
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,730
中文字幕
of text inside the envelope coming back from Stephan or the web server,

508
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,030
中文字幕
more generally, that says 404, Not Found.

509
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,580
中文字幕
And that means the user probably did something wrong

510
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,610
中文字幕
or if the data has simply disappeared from the server.

511
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,960
中文字幕
And there's so many more of these things as well.

512
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,050
中文字幕
And in fact, you might get responses, like we just

513
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,050
中文字幕
did from Harvard, supporting not just 1.1, but version 2 of HTTP.

514
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,340
中文字幕
So just realize if you tinker with your own Mac or PC,

515
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,090
中文字幕
the messages might look a little different

516
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,710
中文字幕
based on your browser and the website.

517
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,960
中文字幕
And that's just because things are evolving over time.

518
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,150
中文字幕
And versions are changing.

519
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,650
中文字幕
But there's so many others of these.

520
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,570
中文字幕
And this is just a short, abbreviated list.

521
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,640
中文字幕
200 and 301 we saw.

522
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,080
中文字幕
404 you yourselves have probably seen.

523
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,630
中文字幕
401 and 403 generally refer to you haven't logged in

524
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,600
中文字幕
or you're just not authorized to access information

525
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,140
中文字幕
because it doesn't belong to you, for instance.

526
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,440
中文字幕
500 you're all going to experience before long--

527
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,480
中文字幕
that 500 is Internal Server Error, which is not

528
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,330
中文字幕
so much the server's error as your fault and my fault

529
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,720
中文字幕
when we've written buggy code.

530
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,750
中文字幕
So in the weeks to come, not this week, but when

531
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,530
中文字幕
we start writing Python code and SQL to talk to databases,

532
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,340
中文字幕
we're all going to screw up at some point.

533
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,450
中文字幕
And a browser will often see a 500 error from a server

534
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,000
中文字幕
if, indeed, there's a problem with code.

535
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,500
中文字幕
418 doesn't actually exist.

536
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,150
中文字幕
This was a April Fools' joke, I think, in, like, 1988,

537
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,950
中文字幕
where some people with a lot of free time

538
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,570
中文字幕
wrote up a whole formal specification for an HTTP status code, a 418,

539
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,870
中文字幕
I am a teapot.

540
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:46,100
中文字幕
And it's still kind of exists in lore, internet lore.

541
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,270
中文字幕
So those are just some of the numbers you might see.

542
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,620
中文字幕
But they're not all that technical if you just know where to look for them

543
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,320
中文字幕
and you know, as a developer now, what they signify for you.

544
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,460
中文字幕
Yeah?

545
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,680
中文字幕
Good question.

546
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,190
中文字幕
What's the difference between 200 OK and 302 Found?

547
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,590
中文字幕
So 302, if you read into the documentation,

548
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,900
中文字幕
would actually tell you that this also induces

549
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,930
中文字幕
a redirect, whereby, just like 301, when the browser gets a 301 or a 302,

550
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,900
中文字幕
the browser should be redirected to the new URL that we saw in the header,

551
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,840
中文字幕
so to speak, called location, colon, whatever it was.

552
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,190
中文字幕
The difference is that Moved Permanently means

553
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,730
中文字幕
that the browser should remember that this redirection is happening

554
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,290
中文字幕
and stop bothering the server with the same original quest.

555
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,470
中文字幕
Just remember what the new URL is.

556
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,020
中文字幕
302 means found it, but don't rely on this.

557
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,610
中文字幕
Keep asking me again and again.

558
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,530
中文字幕
So it's just a performance optimization so you

559
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,820
中文字幕
don't annoy the server unnecessarily in the case of 301s, which just

560
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,290
中文字幕
costs time and money, in some sense.

561
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,060
中文字幕
So you might have heard about this before--

562
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,390
中文字幕
can only get away with this Cambridge, not so much New Haven.

563
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,010
中文字幕
Has anyone ever visited safetyschool.org?

564
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,600
中文字幕
Hey.

565
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,450
中文字幕
You're welcome to on your laptop or your phone.

566
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,900
中文字幕
So some very clever Harvard students, I think, years ago bought this domain.

567
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,240
中文字幕
Frankly, they've probably been paying, like, $10 or more

568
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,510
中文字幕
per year ever since just to keep this joke alive.

569
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,570
中文字幕
But it's wonderfully illustrative because if we go back

570
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,530
中文字幕
to Chrome or any browser--

571
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:19,610
中文字幕
and let me go ahead and open up a browser tab and go to safetyschool.org,

572
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,570
中文字幕
Enter.

573
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,520
中文字幕
Oh, interesting.

574
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,290
中文字幕
Where did I get redirected?

575
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,730
中文字幕
Hey.

576
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,510
中文字幕
So the more interesting question for us is, how are they doing that?

577
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,810
中文字幕
Well, let me go back into the IDE for a--

578
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,780
中文字幕
or actually, let me go into my browser and open up a new tab--

579
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,450
中文字幕
View, Developer, Developer Tools.

580
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,740
中文字幕
Look at the Network tab.

581
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,060
中文字幕
And now let me go ahead--

582
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,860
中文字幕
whoops-- let me go ahead and visit http://safetyschool.org.

583
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,940
中文字幕
Enter.

584
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,770
中文字幕
Scroll back up to the top, where I see the first request.

585
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,600
中文字幕
And you can see, more technically, if this doesn't take the fun out

586
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,910
中文字幕
of the joke, all these Harvard students did

587
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,480
中文字幕
years ago was configure this domain name to return a 301,

588
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,160
中文字幕
Moved Permanently to Yale University.

589
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,000
中文字幕
Now, it's only fair, especially since the Yale students are watching

590
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,560
中文字幕
this live right now from New Haven--

591
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,130
中文字幕
let's take a look at one other site called harvardsucks.org.

592
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,780
中文字幕
So this domain, too, does exist.

593
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:19,590
中文字幕
Let me clear that screen and go to http://harvardsucks.org.

594
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,560
中文字幕
Enter.

595
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,460
中文字幕
And this is an actual website.

596
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,820
中文字幕
So not only did these enterprising Yale students buy the domain name,

597
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,450
中文字幕
they've also been hosting the website for years since.

598
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,750
中文字幕
There's a wonderful YouTube video there that actually speaks to a very fun hack

599
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,450
中文字幕
that they did some years ago at Harvard-Yale, the football game.

600
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,450
中文字幕
But you can see here, oh, that--

601
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,560
中文字幕
so there's a minor one.

602
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,570
中文字幕
So harvardsucks.org actually now lives at www.harvardsucks.org.

603
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,950
中文字幕
But then you actually stay there.

604
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,980
中文字幕
And so I encourage you to go to this site, as well as the other, for all

605
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,010
中文字幕
your Harvard and Yale shopping needs.

606
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,490
中文字幕
So that is HTTP.

607
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:00,620
中文字幕
HTTP is the protocol, the set of conventions, that browsers

608
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,560
中文字幕
use when talking to web servers.

609
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,630
中文字幕
And it's the protocol that governs how those web

610
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,870
中文字幕
servers respond to the browsers.

611
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,000
中文字幕
We've quantized this in the form of these virtual envelopes, which is just

612
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,150
中文字幕
a physical incarnation of the zeros and ones that are technically going

613
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,990
中文字幕
back and forth across the internet.

614
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,350
中文字幕
But it's embodied in my handshake with Stephan, what's really happening.

615
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,120
中文字幕
I initiate.

616
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,840
中文字幕
He responds.

617
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,670
中文字幕
And it's like a client-server type relationship.

618
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,300
中文字幕
So how do you actually now do creative work?

619
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,070
中文字幕
How do you make yale.edu?

620
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,720
中文字幕
How do you make harvardsucks.org?

621
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,240
中文字幕
How do you make CS50's own website or Google or Facebook?

622
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,850
中文字幕
Well, what really matters now what's--

623
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,250
中文字幕
is what's deeper inside of that envelope.

624
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,280
中文字幕
In addition to these headers, this textual information,

625
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,430
中文字幕
like 200 OK or 301 Moved Permanently, there's

626
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,870
中文字幕
another language embedded inside of that envelope, deeper down,

627
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,240
中文字幕
called HTML, HyperText Markup Language.

628
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,560
中文字幕
This is the language, which is also text, in which web pages are written.

629
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,400
中文字幕
And so if you've ever visited a website on the internet,

630
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,460
中文字幕
and I just noticed that Erin is doing that on repeat, isn't she, what's--

631
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,590
中文字幕
you're looking at is a browser's rendering of HTML.

632
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,460
中文字幕
So HTML is just text.

633
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,040
中文字幕
And we're going to see it in a moment.

634
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,290
中文字幕
The browser reads that text top to bottom, left to right, much like Clang

635
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,600
中文字幕
reads your C code top to bottom, left to right.

636
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,560
中文字幕
But rather than convert your text to zeros and ones, what a browser does

637
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,260
中文字幕
is interpret it line by line by line.

638
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,090
中文字幕
And it does what you say.

639
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,420
中文字幕
So if you say, hey, browser, put Erin's photo on the screen,

640
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,780
中文字幕
it is going to do that.

641
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,700
中文字幕
If you say, hey, browser, write the words "staff" in big black text,

642
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,140
中文字幕
the browser's going to do that.

643
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,300
中文字幕
If you tell the browser to lay out a whole menu, it's going to do that.

644
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,230
中文字幕
And we'll see, in just a moment, how you convey those terms.

645
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,910
中文字幕
HTML is not a programming language.

646
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,210
中文字幕
It is, indeed, a markup language, which means it just lays things

647
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,540
中文字幕
out structurally and aesthetically.

648
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,670
中文字幕
So the website here that we're looking at has a bunch of images, all of which

649
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,510
中文字幕
are what are called animated GIFs, which are

650
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,400
中文字幕
very much in vogue these days on Reddit and phones and iMessage and the like.

651
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,280
中文字幕
But those are just images, files, that are actually being transferred

652
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,540
中文字幕
from CS50 server to your browser.

653
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,590
中文字幕
But if I go up to View, Developer, and now View Source, and you can--

654
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,430
中文字幕
could have been doing this all these years--

655
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,380
中文字幕
you can actually see the so-called HTML that drives CD50's website.

656
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,600
中文字幕
So this is all of the HTML, and I'm deliberately

657
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,840
中文字幕
scrolling fast through it, that implements that CS50 staff page.

658
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,640
中文字幕
And if we scroll all the way to the bottom,

659
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,620
中文字幕
you'll see that 1,008 lines later is the web page done.

660
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,520
中文字幕
But it's just text.

661
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,070
中文字幕
And, in fact, let me scroll back up to the top and just point

662
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,260
中文字幕
out a few salient details.

663
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,280
中文字幕
You'll see familiar patterns in the examples

664
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,620
中文字幕
we're about to start looking at.

665
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,160
中文字幕
The very first line probably is that, DOCTYPE HTML, which

666
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,200
中文字幕
is like a little hint to the browser that says,

667
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,920
中文字幕
quite explicitly, hey, browser, the document type you're about to see

668
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,360
中文字幕
is indeed HTML.

669
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,480
中文字幕
But the rest of the web page follows a structural pattern.

670
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,570
中文字幕
And you'll see that it's already nicely indented,

671
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,370
中文字幕
even though some of these lines are a little long and are wrapping.

672
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,210
中文字幕
But you'll see this convention, an open bracket, which is an angled bracket,

673
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,000
中文字幕
like a less than sign, the keyword html, maybe some pattern like this,

674
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,330
中文字幕
lang equals en-us--

675
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,210
中文字幕
this sounds like language-- a US English, maybe--

676
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,130
中文字幕
more on that in a bit-- and then this close bracket, or a greater than sign,

677
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,660
中文字幕
that completes the thought.

678
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,440
中文字幕
Then inside of that HTML tag, so to speak, indented beneath it,

679
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,240
中文字幕
is this, the head of the web page.

680
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,910
中文字幕
The head of the web page something that you mostly can't see.

681
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,730
中文字幕
It generally refers to the tab at the top of the page and just

682
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,170
中文字幕
invisible information.

683
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,620
中文字幕
And if I scroll down further, we'll see, really, the guts of the web page,

684
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,850
中文字幕
which are in the so-called body of the web page.

685
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,900
中文字幕
So these things that I've just been highlighting,

686
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,190
中文字幕
albeit in a very big context of a big, 1,000-line web page,

687
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,920
中文字幕
are just called HTML tags.

688
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,410
中文字幕
HTML is a tag-based language, a markup-based language,

689
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:50,680
中文字幕
where you just say what you want to appear where you want it to appear.

690
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,020
中文字幕
So what does that actually mean?

691
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,990
中文字幕
Well, let's take a look at a simpler example

692
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,770
中文字幕
in the form of this slide, which is perhaps the simplest web page

693
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,110
中文字幕
that you can make, this one here.

694
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,040
中文字幕
This is perhaps the simplest correct, syntactically correct, web

695
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,210
中文字幕
page you can write that's saying, hey, browser, the type of document is HTML.

696
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,740
中文字幕
Hey, browser, here's the start of my HTML page.

697
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,620
中文字幕
Hey, browser, here's the head of my web page.

698
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,700
中文字幕
Hey, browser, here comes the title of my web page.

699
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,320
中文字幕
Hey, browser, the title of this page shall be, for the sake of discussion,

700
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,260
中文字幕
"hello, title."

701
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,650
中文字幕
But you could say literally anything there that you want.

702
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,000
中文字幕
But now things get interesting.

703
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,040
中文字幕
And some of you have certainly seen HTML before, and some of you haven't.

704
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,100
中文字幕
But you can probably just infer, even if you

705
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,180
中文字幕
haven't seen HTML, what this tag is doing because it looks the same,

706
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,460
中文字幕
but yet a little different.

707
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,840
中文字幕
So if this is saying, hey, browser, here comes the title,

708
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,100
中文字幕
what is this probably saying, intuitively?

709
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,940
中文字幕
Just ends.

710
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,440
中文字幕
Yeah.

711
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,590
中文字幕
That's it for the title.

712
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,180
中文字幕
Hey, browser, that's it for the title.

713
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,140
中文字幕
So you might call this a start tag and this an end tag,

714
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,190
中文字幕
or an open tag and a close tag.

715
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,530
中文字幕
Think about it however you want.

716
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,500
中文字幕
But in HTML, there's generally this nice symmetry.

717
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,840
中文字幕
Once you start something, you eventually finish it.

718
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,420
中文字幕
And you do it in the right order.

719
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,340
中文字幕
So you do-- you start tags in one order.

720
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,570
中文字幕
And then you close them in reverse order so that everything is nicely symmetric.

721
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,940
中文字幕
And indeed, the indentation, just like in C,

722
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,560
中文字幕
technically doesn't matter at all.

723
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,820
中文字幕
You could have a really, really ugly web page with no whitespaces whatsoever.

724
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,730
中文字幕
And it would still work fine for the browser because it doesn't care--

725
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,570
中文字幕
just much harder for us humans to read.

726
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,380
中文字幕
So this convention is to indent, just like in C,

727
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,060
中文字幕
just so it's more clear what the hierarchy or the nesting

728
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,170
中文字幕
is, so to speak.

729
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,810
中文字幕
This line here means, hey, browser, that's it for the head.

730
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,040
中文字幕
It's another close tag.

731
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,020
中文字幕
Hey, browser, here comes the body of the page.

732
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,500
中文字幕
So much like head here, body here, most of the page's content

733
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,420
中文字幕
is, indeed, in the body of the web page.

734
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,670
中文字幕
That's what you, the humans, actually see.

735
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,260
中文字幕
And mostly in the head, we'll just see things like the title

736
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,350
中文字幕
and just a couple of other things in a little bit.

737
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,500
中文字幕
The message inside this web page is apparently, "hello, body,"

738
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,330
中文字幕
then close body, close html.

739
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,130
中文字幕
And that's it.

740
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,380
中文字幕
So when I said earlier that inside of these envelopes

741
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,080
中文字幕
is just a whole bunch of text, all I meant was this.

742
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,940
中文字幕
This is what's inside of this envelope just below

743
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,210
中文字幕
the protocol information, the HTTP information, that just said 200 OK

744
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,230
中文字幕
or any of those other messages.

745
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,770
中文字幕
So when the browser receives this envelope, it opens it up.

746
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,470
中文字幕
It reads it top to bottom, left to right.

747
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,030
中文字幕
And then it literally interprets that file top to bottom,

748
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,290
中文字幕
doing exactly what you tell it to do.

749
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,530
中文字幕
So how do we go about actually doing this?

750
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,070
中文字幕
You can write HTML on any text program.

751
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,640
中文字幕
You can write it in TextEdit, on a Mac, on Notepad, on a PC.

752
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,980
中文字幕
You can, technically, use Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

753
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,690
中文字幕
But that's out of context and bad.

754
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,340
中文字幕
Those give you features you don't want.

755
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,140
中文字幕
But you generally want a text editor.

756
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,990
中文字幕
And we, of course, have a text editor in CS50 IDE.

757
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,610
中文字幕
So let me actually go there.

758
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,950
中文字幕
I'm going to go into CS50 IDE.

759
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,320
中文字幕
And I'm going to go up to File, New.

760
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,410
中文字幕
And I'm going to go and preemptively just save the file with the only file

761
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,710
中文字幕
name I remember from earlier, which was index.html.

762
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,300
中文字幕
Just like C programs end in files called something .c,

763
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:52,400
中文字幕
HTML files often end in .html, sometimes .htm, but often .html.

764
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,680
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and click Save there.

765
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,020
中文字幕
And now I'm going to go ahead and do a-- type exactly that same code--

766
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,410
中文字幕
so open bracket, exclamation point.

767
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,750
中文字幕
And that's the only exclamation point we'll expect.

768
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,010
中文字幕
The first line is, unfortunately, a little different from all the others.

769
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,920
中文字幕
Then I'm going to do open bracket, html, close bracket.

770
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,170
中文字幕
And you'll notice that, just like with C, the IDE tries to be a little helpful

771
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,280
中文字幕
and finish your thought.

772
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,410
中文字幕
So it already closed the tag for me.

773
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,560
中文字幕
Now it's just on me to hit Enter to move it into place.

774
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,630
中文字幕
Now I'm going to-- what came next inside the--

775
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,410
中文字幕
uh-oh.

776
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,870
中文字幕
What came next?

777
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,600
中文字幕
The head-- so open bracket, head, close bracket.

778
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,420
中文字幕
Inside of head was--

779
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,510
中文字幕
yeah, title.

780
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,430
中文字幕
And then I think it just said, "hello, title,"

781
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,140
中文字幕
though I could call that anything I want.

782
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,760
中文字幕
Then below the head, but inside the html tag still, was my body.

783
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,810
中文字幕
So let me type that here.

784
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,790
中文字幕
And I think I said, "hello, body."

785
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,750
中文字幕
So-- bdoy, boday.

786
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,980
中文字幕
OK, body-- save.

787
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,280
中文字幕
So now I have a text file in the IDE.

788
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,960
中文字幕
It seems to match up with what we showed as a canonical page before.

789
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,460
中文字幕
Now we need to load it in a browser.

790
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,330
中文字幕
And this is a little paradoxical because I'm,

791
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,690
中文字幕
obviously, writing this text in a browser,

792
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,520
中文字幕
and yet I need the browser to read it.

793
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,180
中文字幕
So this is just because the IDE, Integrated Development Environment,

794
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,160
中文字幕
that we've been using is, itself, web-based.

795
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,680
中文字幕
That's just an incidental detail.

796
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,720
中文字幕
The fact that I have written this code in a file now is what's important.

797
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,160
中文字幕
It could be in the cloud as it is.

798
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,970
中文字幕
It could be on my Mac.

799
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,690
中文字幕
It could be on my PC.

800
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,790
中文字幕
It could be on any other server on the internet.

801
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,520
中文字幕
The point is I need to access this file somehow.

802
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,210
中文字幕
And so it turns out that we're not going to compile it.

803
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,180
中文字幕
There are no zeros and ones involved anymore.

804
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,310
中文字幕
There is no machine code.

805
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,940
中文字幕
We're going to leave it just like this.

806
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,250
中文字幕
HTML is interpreted, literally, line by line, top to bottom--

807
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,050
中文字幕
no zeros and ones needed.

808
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,370
中文字幕
But I am going to need to run my own web server, not the IDE itself.

809
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,430
中文字幕
I want to run, as the developer, my own web server.

810
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,420
中文字幕
What is a web server?

811
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,170
中文字幕
It's like Stephan.

812
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,710
中文字幕
It's just a program sitting there, waiting and waiting

813
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,750
中文字幕
and waiting for something to happen.

814
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,960
中文字幕
And that's something is, presumably, a request from a browser, at which point

815
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,910
中文字幕
it will respond with a handshake or, more specifically, with this file.

816
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,750
中文字幕
So how do I do this?

817
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:07,670
中文字幕
Well, in the IDE, we actually include a free program called http-server.

818
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,760
中文字幕
All of the software in CS50 IDE is free and open source.

819
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,760
中文字幕
So we've simply chosen some of the most popular packages, one of which

820
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,800
中文字幕
is called, literally, http-server.

821
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,100
中文字幕
And if I go ahead and hit Enter, you'll see somewhat cryptic information

822
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,710
中文字幕
at first.

823
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,290
中文字幕
But let's see.

824
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,160
中文字幕
It's starting up the http-server.

825
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,780
中文字幕
It's serving dot slash.

826
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,640
中文字幕
Well, what does dot mean?

827
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,430
中文字幕
This folder.

828
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,320
中文字幕
So just serve up the contents of this current folder that I'm in.

829
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,480
中文字幕
Now it's saying it's available on this URL.

830
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,700
中文字幕
And this URL's going to vary by who is running this.

831
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,540
中文字幕
If you're running it, you're going to see a different URL.

832
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,510
中文字幕
But what is interesting is the number--

833
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,410
中文字幕
turns out that, because this is my little own personal web server,

834
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,650
中文字幕
it's not using port 80, which I claimed earlier was the default.

835
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,490
中文字幕
It's using a different convention, 8080.

836
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,200
中文字幕
8080 is just a human convention.

837
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,090
中文字幕
It's not standardized in the same way.

838
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,000
中文字幕
But this way, I can serve files separate from the IDE

839
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,790
中文字幕
because the IDE itself is actually listening on port 80,

840
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,970
中文字幕
or, technically, 443, because it's using HTTPS.

841
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,350
中文字幕
And I don't want to confuse my files with CS50 IDE's own files,

842
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,690
中文字幕
the actual user interface that you're all familiar with.

843
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,230
中文字幕
So, just like Stephan can hear from--

844
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,170
中文字幕
say hello to multiple people and Google servers can handle multiple services,

845
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:23,400
中文字幕
so can my own IDE listen on multiple ports, as they're called--

846
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,500
中文字幕
80, 25, 443, or, in this case, 8080.

847
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,630
中文字幕
So what does this all mean?

848
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,060
中文字幕
I'm going to go ahead and literally click on this URL,

849
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,870
中文字幕
open it in another tab on my browser, and you'll see somewhat cryptic output.

850
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:38,280
中文字幕
But this is just a succinct way of saying, here is the index, the listing,

851
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,850
中文字幕
of slash, which is now the default area of my website.

852
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,710
中文字幕
I've got two folders, source 5, which is on the course's website--

853
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,760
中文字幕
it's all of today's files in case we want to look them up without writing

854
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,810
中文字幕
them from scratch--

855
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,570
中文字幕
and then the file I just created, index.html.

856
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:57,580
中文字幕
So if I go ahead now and click on index.html, there we have it-- hello,

857
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,080
中文字幕
body.

858
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,620
中文字幕
And we don't see the tab just because I full-screened Chrome.

859
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,000
中文字幕
But if I actually remove that full screening

860
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,490
中文字幕
and zoom up to the top of the tab, you see "hello, title" there.

861
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,350
中文字幕
And if I go back into this file, meanwhile, and I say,

862
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:15,630
中文字幕
"hello, body, nice to meet you"-- this one got weird--

863
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,450
中文字幕
now I'm going to go ahead and click reload.

864
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,320
中文字幕
And now you see this.

865
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,120
中文字幕
Let's go ahead and take a five-minute break

866
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,030
中文字幕
sooner, rather than later, so that we can address the projector issue.

867
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,100
中文字幕
And we'll be right back.

868
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,990
中文字幕
So to recap, there are more tags than just html and head and title and body.

869
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,750
中文字幕
There's things that give us images and sounds, certainly,

870
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,170
中文字幕
and many, many, many other things.

871
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,070
中文字幕
So let's take a look more manually at just one or two other examples

872
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,570
中文字幕
and then get a sense of the whole menu of tags that might be available.

873
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,320
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and create a new file now.

874
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,800
中文字幕
And I'll go ahead and call this image.html.

875
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,850
中文字幕
And in anticipation of making a demonstration now

876
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,740
中文字幕
that has an image, to save time, I'm just

877
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,560
中文字幕
going to go ahead and paste the contents of the previous file.

878
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,800
中文字幕
But I'm going to go ahead and get rid of the body this time

879
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,260
中文字幕
and start to actually embed an image in here.

880
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,390
中文字幕
Now, in advance, I've downloaded an image of Yale's own bulldog, Handsome

881
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,010
中文字幕
Dan, in a file called dan.jpeg.

882
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,470
中文字幕
And I've uploaded it to the IDE in the same folder

883
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,520
中文字幕
that index.html is in and now that image.html is in.

884
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,790
中文字幕
And you can include an image by using an img tag.

885
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,600
中文字幕
But you have to specify to the browser what the image you actually

886
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,590
中文字幕
want to embed is.

887
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,580
中文字幕
And so to do this, as you may know, we have attributes.

888
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:28,200
中文字幕
So just like the html tag, as we saw earlier and can now see in the example

889
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,560
中文字幕
here, has a language attribute specifying English as the default

890
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,620
中文字幕
language for this page to help things like Google Translate and the like,

891
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,970
中文字幕
so does the image tag get modified by this attribute called source.

892
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,970
中文字幕
It's just src and img because those are more succinct

893
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,800
中文字幕
representations of "image" and "source"-- saves us some keystrokes.

894
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,540
中文字幕
And now I can type in here dan.jpeg.

895
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,360
中文字幕
And then, just for good measure--

896
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,810
中文字幕
well, rather, I can then close the tag using the corresponding angle

897
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,790
中文字幕
bracket, the greater than sign.

898
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,370
中文字幕
But whereas all of the other tags thus far

899
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,640
中文字幕
have a notion of starting and stopping or opening and closing,

900
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,210
中文字幕
the image tag doesn't because the image is either there or it's not.

901
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,550
中文字幕
There's really no conceptual notion of starting an image

902
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,460
中文字幕
and then eventually stopping an image.

903
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,810
中文字幕
But let's add one other detail.

904
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,970
中文字幕
It turns out that there's yet other attributes.

905
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,580
中文字幕
So you can have zero or more on any tag.

906
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,200
中文字幕
For folks who have trouble seeing content on web pages

907
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,160
中文字幕
and, indeed, rely on tools like screen readers,

908
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,740
中文字幕
there's actually attributes that can help in cases like that--

909
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,880
中文字幕
turns out there's an alternative tag, or alt, where you can actually say,

910
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,260
中文字幕
"photo of Handsome Dan," which is a textual description of whatever it

911
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,760
中文字幕
is you're embedding in the web page.

912
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,550
中文字幕
This way, someone who's not sighted but who

913
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,540
中文字幕
has a screen reader that can read that to them

914
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,060
中文字幕
can actually understand what it is that's on the web page.

915
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,090
中文字幕
So most folks wouldn't see that unless you actually hover over it

916
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,810
中文字幕
or have it spoken to you.

917
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:51,120
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and save this file, go back to the index of the web server

918
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,840
中文字幕
that I ran earlier with http-server, and now click on image.

919
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,560
中文字幕
And voila.

920
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,980
中文字幕
You'll see dan.jpeg embedded in the web page.

921
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,070
中文字幕
Of course, this web page doesn't actually do all that much yet.

922
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:06,170
中文字幕
And so suppose we actually wanted to link to one page or another.

923
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,380
中文字幕
Well, we can do that as well.

924
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,670
中文字幕
Let me go back to the IDE, copy this same code, just as a starting point,

925
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,790
中文字幕
create a new file called link.html.

926
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,250
中文字幕
And then in this file, we'll start with the same contents.

927
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,890
中文字幕
But let me get rid of that body and simply say,

928
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,180
中文字幕
for instance-- let's have people visit Harvard.

929
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:29,310
中文字幕
So I could say visit https, for secure, www.harvard.edu/,

930
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,730
中文字幕
or maybe even without the slash-- it doesn't matter for the default page--

931
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,480
中文字幕
period.

932
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,740
中文字幕
Let me save this.

933
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,560
中文字幕
Let me go back to the index of the web server,

934
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,200
中文字幕
reload so that I can see the new file, link.html, that I created,

935
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
中文字幕
and now click link.html.

936
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,960
中文字幕
And voila.

937
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,070
中文字幕
So it's a URL visually.

938
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,410
中文字幕
But it's not actually clickable.

939
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,480
中文字幕
But that's because the browser's only going to do what you told it to do.

940
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,670
中文字幕
And all I've implicitly told it to do is display this black text here.

941
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,580
中文字幕
If I actually want to make it interactive, I need another tag.

942
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:04,080
中文字幕
Well, it turns out in HTML, there's an anchor tag, somewhat cryptically named.

943
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,960
中文字幕
And it's also succinctly written as a, for anchor.

944
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,660
中文字幕
And with the anchor tag can you anchor at this point in the page

945
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,850
中文字幕
a link, or a hyper-reference, as it was once called, to that specific URL.

946
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,330
中文字幕
So that attribute, by convention, is called href, hyper-reference.

947
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,460
中文字幕
That is the destination to which you want to link.

948
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,990
中文字幕
I can now close that tag.

949
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,600
中文字幕
But I now need to tell the user where they're going.

950
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,860
中文字幕
So I could just say Harvard, for instance, and put my period out there.

951
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,250
中文字幕
Save the file.

952
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,800
中文字幕
Go back to the tab here.

953
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,830
中文字幕
Click Reload.

954
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,170
中文字幕
And now you'll see the dichotomy.

955
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,920
中文字幕
I'm seeing one thing, Harvard.

956
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,990
中文字幕
But if you hover over it, and it's super small here,

957
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,990
中文字幕
you can actually see, as a safety check, in the bottom left-hand corner,

958
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,350
中文字幕
typically, the URL that you'll actually be led to.

959
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,550
中文字幕
Now, as an aside, with this very, very simple feature of HTML,

960
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,520
中文字幕
you can actually socially engineer people,

961
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,600
中文字幕
as is commonly done with phishing attacks, P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G.

962
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,810
中文字幕
If you've ever gotten some spam, either in your inbox or your spam folder,

963
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,080
中文字幕
odds are someone's tried to ask you for your username and password

964
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,900
中文字幕
or for your money or for your PayPal account.

965
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,020
中文字幕
PayPal is especially a common target here.

966
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,990
中文字幕
But you can see how you can very easily, unfortunately,

967
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,810
中文字幕
trick and mislead people, especially if they don't necessarily

968
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,460
中文字幕
understand some of these fundamentals.

969
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,030
中文字幕
Let me go back here, for instance, and say here--

970
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,370
中文字幕
well, there's nothing stopping me from doing this little mischievous trick.

971
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:27,780
中文字幕
I can change the href to Yale, but the text to Harvard,

972
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,980
中文字幕
thereby tricking someone.

973
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,940
中文字幕
Ha ha.

974
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,880
中文字幕
You're actually going to Yale's website instead.

975
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,030
中文字幕
But more maliciously, and in these phishing emails or spams

976
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,580
中文字幕
that you might have been getting over the past several years,

977
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:43,920
中文字幕
you could imagine typing anything you want here, like paypal.com.

978
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,520
中文字幕
And then here could be www.SomeMaliciousWeb

979
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,900
中文字幕
siteThatWantsYourMoney--

980
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,640
中文字幕
hopefully, that does not exist-- .com.

981
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,430
中文字幕
Save.

982
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,750
中文字幕
Reload the page.

983
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,030
中文字幕
And honestly, most people, myself included,

984
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:06,470
中文字幕
are not going to always paranoically check where I'm actually going.

985
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,890
中文字幕
I'm just going to click on a link.

986
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,400
中文字幕
And voila.

987
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,740
中文字幕
You might not notice the URL bar changing because you're

988
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,190
中文字幕
being whisked away to some website.

989
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,880
中文字幕
And honestly, it's not all that hard to recreate websites.

990
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,060
中文字幕
In fact, just to really hammer this point home, let me go to paypal.com.

991
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,050
中文字幕
And using today's primitives, notice that you

992
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,080
中文字幕
can go to View, Developer, View Source.

993
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,200
中文字幕
This is the HTML implementing PayPal's website--

994
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,890
中文字幕
looks good.

995
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:36,240
中文字幕
Let me copy and paste that into, say, a new file called paypal.html.

996
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,250
中文字幕
Let me save that here.

997
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,780
中文字幕
Now let me go back to my web server, reload, open paypal.html.

998
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,730
中文字幕
And voila.

999
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:44,880
中文字幕
I have made PayPal.

1000
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,520
中文字幕
So it's not even that hard to mimic where people think they are going.

1001
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,440
中文字幕
Now, intellectual property issues aside, that I just copied and pasted

1002
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,330
中文字幕
someone else's website, this is clearly not

1003
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,230
中文字幕
fully operational because what I don't have access to their database

1004
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:02,280
中文字幕
and their code on the server and all of the intellectual property and business

1005
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,950
中文字幕
logic, so to speak, that actually makes PayPal what it is.

1006
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,490
中文字幕
But HTML, the point is, is purely openly accessible by anyone.

1007
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,330
中文字幕
It's not encrypted.

1008
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,640
中文字幕
It's not zeros and ones.

1009
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,120
中文字幕
But it tends to be so aesthetic and structural in nature that that's not

1010
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,980
中文字幕
really the juicy stuff in a business.

1011
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,540
中文字幕
But this technique can certainly be abused in this way.

1012
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,350
中文字幕
So moving forward, just be more mindful of this because most emails

1013
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,600
中文字幕
you get these days by a Gmail or any tool

1014
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,940
中文字幕
are themselves implemented in HTML.

1015
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,740
中文字幕
Even when you're typing out a Gmail message

1016
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,410
中文字幕
and have never even thought about HTML, that email

1017
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,480
中文字幕
is actually being sent underneath the hood as HTML.

1018
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,690
中文字幕
Why-- well, if you've ever used a bulleted list or a numbered list,

1019
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,000
中文字幕
if you do boldfacing or italics or any of those aesthetic features in Gmail

1020
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,450
中文字幕
or other programs, those are implemented as HTML,

1021
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,530
中文字幕
but just using nice, user-friendly interfaces.

1022
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,050
中文字幕
So you can just click icons.

1023
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,230
中文字幕
You don't have to think about open bracket, something, close bracket.

1024
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,410
中文字幕
But we could do that.

1025
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,620
中文字幕
For instance, if we go ahead and look at a few other examples--

1026
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:01,080
中文字幕
let me go ahead here and actually go back to our very first one, index.html.

1027
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,190
中文字幕
And suppose I just want to really draw attention to "hello."

1028
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,510
中文字幕
I can actually use the strong tag, which implies bold, typically.

1029
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,740
中文字幕
Save that.

1030
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,130
中文字幕
Let me go back to the web server that I had open a moment ago.

1031
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,750
中文字幕
Click on index.html after reloading it.

1032
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,750
中文字幕
And now it's a little subtle because it's small.

1033
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,170
中文字幕
But you can probably see that "hello" is indeed boldfaced now.

1034
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:26,040
中文字幕
So if you've ever clicked the B icon in Gmail, that's all it's doing.

1035
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,550
中文字幕
Underneath the hood, Gmail is taking your word, hello, and

1036
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:33,690
中文字幕
secretly putting open bracket, strong, close bracket, and then the opposite,

1037
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,290
中文字幕
the close tag, after it.

1038
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,800
中文字幕
And that's what it's sending to the recipient of that message.

1039
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,940
中文字幕
So what else can you do?

1040
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,350
中文字幕
Well, let me go ahead and do this.

1041
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:45,810
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and open up, say, a few files that I created in advance.

1042
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:48,990
中文字幕
One is called paragraphs.html.

1043
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,850
中文字幕
And let me point this out first.

1044
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:55,230
中文字幕
So in paragraphs, I just have three paragraphs of Latin text.

1045
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,730
中文字幕
And they are rendered, for instance, as follows.

1046
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:01,500
中文字幕
If I go into source 5 and I go into paragraphs.html--

1047
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,050
中文字幕
looks nice-- don't know what it says.

1048
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,750
中文字幕
And, in fact, it's pretty much gibberish.

1049
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,620
中文字幕
But it's nice, three nice paragraphs.

1050
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,740
中文字幕
But notice how pedantic HTML is.

1051
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,940
中文字幕
I actually had to use another tag to achieve those paragraphs, even.

1052
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,990
中文字幕
If I only had, very reasonably, written these three paragraphs

1053
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,970
中文字幕
like you might in Google Docs or Microsoft Word,

1054
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,100
中文字幕
it's just three paragraphs.

1055
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:23,850
中文字幕
Indent each.

1056
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,830
中文字幕
Hit Enter, Enter in between them-- looks good.

1057
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,200
中文字幕
It's wrapping because it's a really long paragraph off to the right.

1058
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,100
中文字幕
But that's fine.

1059
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,810
中文字幕
And I save this.

1060
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,690
中文字幕
And I go to paragraphs and reload.

1061
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:36,530
中文字幕
Notice that it all bunches together.

1062
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:40,620
中文字幕
Intuitively, why is that happening, though?

1063
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:44,000
中文字幕
What's the logic behind this bug now, albeit an aesthetic bug?

1064
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,320
中文字幕
Yeah?

1065
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,240
中文字幕
Yeah.

1066
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,070
中文字幕
Those additional spaces are not being accounted for.

1067
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,820
中文字幕
They're just being pushed together because

1068
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,010
中文字幕
even though HTML does respect one space--

1069
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,490
中文字幕
otherwise, everything would be completely smushed--

1070
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:04,030
中文字幕
it ignores multiple spaces, whether it's new lines or tabs

1071
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,650
中文字幕
or multiple hits of the space bar.

1072
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,060
中文字幕
And it only does, ultimately, what you tell it to do.

1073
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:12,010
中文字幕
So unless you explicitly, with tags in HTML, say, give me a new paragraph,

1074
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,260
中文字幕
that's it for this paragraph, give me a new paragraph,

1075
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,270
中文字幕
else that's-- now that's it for the paragraph,

1076
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,490
中文字幕
it's just going to clump them all together,

1077
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,560
中文字幕
maybe separating with a single space, which is clearly not the effect we

1078
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,060
中文字幕
want.

1079
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,670
中文字幕
So just remember that HTML is really nit-picky when it comes to that.

1080
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,510
中文字幕
And much like in C, your code won't compile if it's not quite right.

1081
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,660
中文字幕
In HTML, it will display.

1082
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,910
中文字幕
But it's not going to display quite right--

1083
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:34,960
中文字幕
is the key there.

1084
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,940
中文字幕
Well, what other features does this HTML have?

1085
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,310
中文字幕
The reality is-- we'll give you a general conceptual overview of HTML

1086
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:40,810
中文字幕
today.

1087
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,370
中文字幕
We'll give you a taste of some of the tags.

1088
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,580
中文字幕
But the reality is this, too, is the sort of language

1089
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,630
中文字幕
that you can really learn by doing and by looking

1090
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:50,170
中文字幕
at online references or texts that actually summarize the various tags.

1091
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,310
中文字幕
But let's look at least a few more.

1092
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:56,230
中文字幕
Let me go into now headings.html.

1093
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,430
中文字幕
And you'll see this--

1094
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:02,140
中文字幕
turns out that there are tags called h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6.

1095
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,190
中文字幕
These are very commonly used on websites that

1096
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,960
中文字幕
have different headings, like big and bold, a little smaller and bold,

1097
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,770
中文字幕
a little smaller and bold to do, like, chapter and section headings.

1098
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,300
中文字幕
CS50's website is very hierarchical.

1099
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,540
中文字幕
If you look through the syllabus, you'll see lots of different font sizes

1100
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,070
中文字幕
and boldfacing and the like.

1101
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,220
中文字幕
That derives from our using these built-in heading tags.

1102
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,450
中文字幕
If I go ahead and open this in my browser, we will see the effect.

1103
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,100
中文字幕
By default, h1 is big and bold.

1104
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,610
中文字幕
H2 is big, but not as big and bold.

1105
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,900
中文字幕
H3 is a little smaller.

1106
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,610
中文字幕
H4, 5, and 6--

1107
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:36,640
中文字幕
and this follows the paradigm in academic papers and books

1108
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,190
中文字幕
that have chapters and sections and subsections and the like.

1109
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:42,280
中文字幕
You just get this feature for free from HTML.

1110
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,330
中文字幕
Well, what else is there?

1111
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,280
中文字幕
Well, if you actually have tabular data, things

1112
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,510
中文字幕
you want to lay out in rows and columns, well, it

1113
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,480
中文字幕
turns out that HTML supports tables.

1114
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,220
中文字幕
Let's glimpse at this, too.

1115
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,990
中文字幕
And if I go into table.html, in my browser, we'll see this effect.

1116
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,380
中文字幕
It's not all that interesting.

1117
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,790
中文字幕
I kind of mimic the idea of a phone pad, where these numbers are lining up

1118
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,740
中文字幕
in columns and in rows.

1119
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,730
中文字幕
But invisibly, this thing is actually laid out with tags.

1120
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,570
中文字幕
If I go to the IDE and look down in here,

1121
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,880
中文字幕
you'll see some copy-paste of before--

1122
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,860
中文字幕
html, head, and body.

1123
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,240
中文字幕
But then notice here.

1124
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,310
中文字幕
Hey, browser, here comes a table.

1125
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,850
中文字幕
And you see, albeit surrounded by unfamiliar tags, probably, 1, 2, 3, 4,

1126
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,420
中文字幕
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and then the symbols down there.

1127
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:29,270
中文字幕
So let's just infer, because the reality is much of your learning of HTML

1128
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,020
中文字幕
and soon another language, we'll see-- it will just be indirectly.

1129
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,170
中文字幕
If you're curious as to how some web page is implementing some feature,

1130
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,710
中文字幕
you actually look at its source code.

1131
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,930
中文字幕
And you infer, by example, how you could do the same.

1132
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:39,610
中文字幕
So take a guess.

1133
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:42,820
中文字幕
If this tag, effectively, says, hey, browser here comes the table,

1134
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,770
中文字幕
this tag here, even if you've never seen HTML, probably means table row.

1135
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,990
中文字幕
Hey, browser, here comes a row in my table.

1136
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,040
中文字幕
This one's less obvious.

1137
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,730
中文字幕
But td, td, td stands for table data or table cell.

1138
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,730
中文字幕
So, hey, browser, here comes a cell, another cell, another cell,

1139
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,260
中文字幕
three of them in total.

1140
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,390
中文字幕
Hey, browser, that's it for this row.

1141
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,860
中文字幕
And then repeat the pattern.

1142
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,470
中文字幕
So here's where HTML just gets a little mundane after a while.

1143
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:08,260
中文字幕
Once you see the name of the tag and once you know what attributes,

1144
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,450
中文字幕
if any, it supports, you just follow this pattern.

1145
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,910
中文字幕
That's it for HTML.

1146
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:12,820
中文字幕
There's start tags.

1147
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,810
中文字幕
There's end tags.

1148
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:16,480
中文字幕
And sometimes, they're not even end tags, if they're not needed.

1149
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,530
中文字幕
And there's attributes.

1150
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,760
中文字幕
And that's HTML.

1151
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,400
中文字幕
Now, if you want to be sure that your code is correct,

1152
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,520
中文字幕
you have a few options.

1153
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:28,120
中文字幕
Let me actually go ahead and open up, for instance, hello.html from earlier,

1154
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,680
中文字幕
just so I have a simple example--

1155
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,630
中文字幕
or index.html from earlier.

1156
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:36,190
中文字幕
Let me go to validator.w3.org--

1157
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:39,280
中文字幕
turns out there's tools out there that will just help give you feedback on

1158
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,460
中文字幕
whether or not your HTML is valid, is correct.

1159
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,000
中文字幕
And this is useful because sometimes, it might look OK to you on Chrome.

1160
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,240
中文字幕
But honestly, if your friend or family member visits the exact same page

1161
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,720
中文字幕
on Edge or IE or Safari or Firefox, it might not

1162
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,620
中文字幕
look the same because the companies that make those browsers sometimes

1163
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,810
中文字幕
disagree on how to render HTML.

1164
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,880
中文字幕
And so if it's not 100% correct, you're only

1165
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,300
中文字幕
incurring more risk that something might render incorrectly.

1166
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,910
中文字幕
I went ahead and clicked Check after pasting my code in.

1167
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,830
中文字幕
And this is good-- document checking complete,

1168
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,260
中文字幕
no errors or warnings to show.

1169
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,610
中文字幕
So when it comes time for Pset5 and you're dabbling with HTML,

1170
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,830
中文字幕
know that there are tools out there, this one included,

1171
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:17,080
中文字幕
and we'll point you at it in the spec, that just helps give you

1172
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,330
中文字幕
feedback on whether something is broken so that you can, with more confidence,

1173
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:24,300
中文字幕
know that it's going to work OK.

1174
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,980
中文字幕
Well, let's make something a little more interesting now.

1175
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,280
中文字幕
Let's re-implement Google, and not by this little copy-paste trick,

1176
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,370
中文字幕
where we just copy their HTML and use it ourselves.

1177
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:37,690
中文字幕
Let's actually now make a user interface that uses Google, in some way.

1178
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,460
中文字幕
So Google, of course, in all of its forms,

1179
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,820
中文字幕
ultimately has a text box into which you can type information.

1180
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,340
中文字幕
And if I go ahead and do this, it turns out

1181
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,940
中文字幕
that Google is generally going to redirect me to a certain URL.

1182
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,730
中文字幕
If I search for "cats" and hit Enter, notice

1183
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:55,040
中文字幕
I got redirected to a pretty cryptic-looking URL.

1184
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,500
中文字幕
There's a lot of metadata in there.

1185
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,480
中文字幕
There's a lot of advertising information these days and all that.

1186
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,860
中文字幕
But it turns out, and I know this just from experience,

1187
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,070
中文字幕
I could distill this URL into this.

1188
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,730
中文字幕
And it will still work.

1189
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,320
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and hit Enter.

1190
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:09,820
中文字幕
Whoops.

1191
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,110
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and hit Enter after simplifying this to question mark q

1192
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,100
中文字幕
equals cats.

1193
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,880
中文字幕
Enter.

1194
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,510
中文字幕
And indeed, I get the same page of cats back.

1195
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,840
中文字幕
So what's going on?

1196
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,420
中文字幕
So the URL itself is not all that remarkable.

1197
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,850
中文字幕
We've seen ww before.

1198
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,690
中文字幕
You've certainly used google.com before.

1199
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,650
中文字幕
This means it's secure.

1200
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,120
中文字幕
It's speaking HTTPS.

1201
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,880
中文字幕
All of this now is old hat.

1202
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,690
中文字幕
It's not requesting index.html because Google is dynamic.

1203
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,230
中文字幕
The content is constantly changing.

1204
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:39,760
中文字幕
There's not some human whose job it is to update Google's home page every day

1205
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,780
中文字幕
with HTML.

1206
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,910
中文字幕
So they, instead, have a piece of software running,

1207
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:48,790
中文字幕
written in Python or C++ or Java or who knows underneath the hood that is just

1208
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,000
中文字幕
listening at this address.

1209
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,870
中文字幕
So it doesn't have to be text files that humans created.

1210
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,100
中文字幕
It can actually be a program.

1211
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,210
中文字幕
This one is called Search.

1212
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,000
中文字幕
And in just a week or two's time, you, too,

1213
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,410
中文字幕
will write programs in a language called Python that can do the same thing.

1214
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,890
中文字幕
But for now, we'll let Google do the heavy lifting.

1215
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,240
中文字幕
And notice the question mark.

1216
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,720
中文字幕
If you ever see a question mark in a URL, this means to the browser,

1217
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,440
中文字幕
here comes some user input, something that the user probably

1218
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,520
中文字幕
typed into the form, just like I did "cats" a moment ago.

1219
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,400
中文字幕
And then you're going to see something equals

1220
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,720
中文字幕
something, which indicates what the human typed in.

1221
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,970
中文字幕
Now, just because Larry and Sergey, some 20 years ago,

1222
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,630
中文字幕
decided with google.com that this text box that we saw a moment ago,

1223
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,060
中文字幕
the big box that's now positioned here--

1224
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,820
中文字幕
they decided years ago that the name for that text box

1225
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,680
中文字幕
is going to be q for query--

1226
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,420
中文字幕
but you can call it anything you want.

1227
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,400
中文字幕
"Cats" is, obviously, what I typed in.

1228
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,920
中文字幕
The equal sign is just associating the two together.

1229
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,820
中文字幕
So this URL just means to Google, hey, Google, run the search program,

1230
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,410
中文字幕
passing in a user input name of q whose value shall be "cats."

1231
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:51,080
中文字幕
And that is how Google knows what to search for, for any of us.

1232
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,290
中文字幕
And frankly, I can search for "dogs," not even just

1233
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,710
中文字幕
by typing the word "dogs" in here.

1234
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,340
中文字幕
I can be a little more precise and type it into this query

1235
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,940
中文字幕
because I now know Google's URL format.

1236
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,440
中文字幕
And voila.

1237
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,590
中文字幕
Now I get search results for "dogs" instead.

1238
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,180
中文字幕
But that's it.

1239
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,770
中文字幕
That's the basic building block that's been happening all this time.

1240
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,300
中文字幕
And even though the URL a moment ago was longer and uglier,

1241
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,760
中文字幕
that was just uninteresting detail.

1242
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,620
中文字幕
It's not the core business that the search is actually providing.

1243
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,300
中文字幕
So what does this mean?

1244
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,360
中文字幕
I can actually now make my own user interface for Google

1245
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,530
中文字幕
by using a few new tags as well.

1246
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,900
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and copy this, as a starting point.

1247
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,730
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and create a new file called search.html.

1248
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,550
中文字幕
Just to save time, I'll type that in there.

1249
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,640
中文字幕
And I'll call this search.

1250
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,620
中文字幕
And I'm going to get rid of the "hello" body.

1251
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,420
中文字幕
So I just have a starting point.

1252
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,150
中文字幕
That's just the same HTML I'm copying and pasting every time.

1253
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,510
中文字幕
Well, it turns out in HTML, there is a tag

1254
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:43,450
中文字幕
called form that will give you a form for user input.

1255
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:47,830
中文字幕
And it turns out that inside of a form, you can have different tags as well--

1256
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,450
中文字幕
specifically, an input.

1257
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,710
中文字幕
And inputs have names.

1258
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:55,450
中文字幕
So I can say name equals "q" to mimic Larry and Sergey's decision years ago,

1259
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,650
中文字幕
the founders of Google.

1260
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,330
中文字幕
The type of this input is text.

1261
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:01,380
中文字幕
So it's not a button or a check box or something like that.

1262
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,090
中文字幕
Those exist, too.

1263
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:03,170
中文字幕
It's just text.

1264
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:04,510
中文字幕
And then I want a Submit button.

1265
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,790
中文字幕
And I just know, from having done this before,

1266
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:10,360
中文字幕
that I can get a Submit button by doing type equals submit.

1267
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,930
中文字幕
And then the value of that is going to be Search,

1268
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,980
中文字幕
which is the word I'm going to see on the screen.

1269
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,420
中文字幕
You would only know this by having seen it

1270
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,640
中文字幕
by someone else doing it, looking at someone's source code,

1271
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,760
中文字幕
reading an online tutorial.

1272
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,980
中文字幕
It's not necessarily obvious.

1273
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,220
中文字幕
But the pattern is the same-- tag name, attribute equals something,

1274
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,040
中文字幕
attribute equals something, and so forth.

1275
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,250
中文字幕
Well, now let me go ahead and save this, go into the web server,

1276
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,470
中文字幕
and reload the index.

1277
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:35,950
中文字幕
So there's my search.html.

1278
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,870
中文字幕
And it's not quite as pretty as Google's.

1279
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,400
中文字幕
Let me zoom in so it's bigger.

1280
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,750
中文字幕
But I do have a text box.

1281
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,360
中文字幕
And I have a button whose label is Search.

1282
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,640
中文字幕
But I don't know yet where to send it.

1283
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,310
中文字幕
I need one more attribute or two here.

1284
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:52,900
中文字幕
It turns out that I want this form to take the action of sending this

1285
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:58,690
中文字幕
information to www.google.com/search, the search program on Google's server.

1286
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,940
中文字幕
But I want it to use that special verb we saw a moment ago.

1287
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,970
中文字幕
And again, this was deeper in the envelope.

1288
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:08,390
中文字幕
The method I wanted to use is get, in lowercase in this case--

1289
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,060
中文字幕
so a little low-level and technical now.

1290
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,970
中文字幕
But this just means that's the verb you should use inside the envelope

1291
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,060
中文字幕
to get the web page.

1292
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,040
中文字幕
But that's it.

1293
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,010
中文字幕
I've told the web page the action you should take

1294
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:22,030
中文字幕
is submit this form to this URL using get, the method we saw earlier.

1295
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:24,160
中文字幕
Submit a parameter, as it's called, called

1296
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,150
中文字幕
q, with whatever the human typed in.

1297
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,240
中文字幕
And then have it give us a Search button here.

1298
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,520
中文字幕
So let me save this, go back to my page, reload.

1299
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,580
中文字幕
And now let's go ahead and search for "mice" this time and click Search.

1300
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,630
中文字幕
And voila.

1301
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:40,240
中文字幕
There we have a whole lot of mice search results.

1302
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,830
中文字幕
But why, is the question?

1303
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:45,790
中文字幕
Well, all I've done is, using HTML and an HTML form,

1304
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,820
中文字幕
is I've generated the prescribed format of a URL,

1305
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:53,410
中文字幕
calling Google's Search program with a input of q equals mice.

1306
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:56,050
中文字幕
And now, as an aside, if I did take more inputs,

1307
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,850
中文字幕
they would be something like this--

1308
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:01,870
中文字幕
something equals value ampersand something equals value.

1309
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,910
中文字幕
Ampersands just separate these key-value pairs

1310
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,620
中文字幕
if you have multiple inputs on the page.

1311
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,560
中文字幕
But the principle is ultimately the same.

1312
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,670
中文字幕
So it's pretty powerful.

1313
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,770
中文字幕
I've not implemented Google, per se.

1314
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:15,040
中文字幕
I've implemented the front end, the user interface.

1315
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,740
中文字幕
And in future, we can we maybe start to work on the logic behind the scenes.

1316
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:23,150
中文字幕
So any questions then on HTTP and now the convergence with HTML?

1317
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,700
中文字幕


1318
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:30,190
中文字幕
You feel comfy with HTML, because we're about to move on to another language?

1319
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,070
中文字幕
Yeah?

1320
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,000
中文字幕
So all of my examples have looked ugly thus far, except for PayPal.

1321
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
中文字幕
That looked pretty nice.

1322
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,470
中文字幕
But I just copied and pasted it.

1323
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:41,840
中文字幕
So how do we begin to style our websites in a more compelling way?

1324
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,840
中文字幕
HTML, at the end of the day, is mostly used for structure of a web page,

1325
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,000
中文字幕
just laying out the data that you care about, the words that you care about,

1326
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,350
中文字幕
the images that you care about.

1327
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,630
中文字幕
But the aesthetics that last miles, so to speak,

1328
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,470
中文字幕
of the really pretty colors and the right font sizes and positioning

1329
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,090
中文字幕
things exactly where you want them--

1330
01:00:56,090 --> 01:01:00,670
中文字幕
that is the job of another language called CSS, Cascading Style Sheets.

1331
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,300
中文字幕
This, too-- not a programming language.

1332
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,790
中文字幕
It's entirely aesthetic in its nature.

1333
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,490
中文字幕
So let's go ahead and take a look at an example.

1334
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:11,180
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and open up the same web server as before,

1335
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,310
中文字幕
open up an example I saw early--

1336
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:16,790
中文字幕
that I made earlier called css0.html.

1337
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:20,100
中文字幕
Suppose that this is the home page that I want to create for John Harvard.

1338
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,400
中文字幕
And notice I've got his name, big and bold, at the top.

1339
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,650
中文字幕
And I've got a slightly smaller font in the middle and a slightly smaller font

1340
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,230
中文字幕
below it.

1341
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:28,190
中文字幕
But these are just minor font size differences.

1342
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,350
中文字幕
It's all centered in the page here.

1343
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:33,830
中文字幕
How would I actually make this website?

1344
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:37,940
中文字幕
Well, let me go ahead and go into a new file here.

1345
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,680
中文字幕
I'll call it css0.html.

1346
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,980
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and paste my starting point, as before.

1347
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,840
中文字幕
And I'll call this css0.

1348
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,960
中文字幕
And then in the body of this page is where

1349
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,920
中文字幕
I'm going to go ahead and lay out that content.

1350
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,200
中文字幕
So as I recall, I had John Harvard.

1351
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:56,350
中文字幕
And then below that, it was "Welcome to my home page!

1352
01:01:56,350 --> 01:02:00,710
中文字幕
Copyright," and funky symbol-- so I'll just do that for now--

1353
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,330
中文字幕
"John Harvard."

1354
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:03,440
中文字幕
Save.

1355
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,300
中文字幕
So that's css0.html.

1356
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,090
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and reload it back from my server.

1357
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:11,960
中文字幕
And voila.

1358
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,230
中文字幕
So what's wrong, aesthetically?

1359
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,610
中文字幕
It's, obviously, all on one line.

1360
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:17,110
中文字幕
But why?

1361
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,090
中文字幕
How do I fix this, as before?

1362
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:19,810
中文字幕
Yeah?

1363
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:21,980
中文字幕
Yeah.

1364
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,140
中文字幕
So I could add the paragraph tags, just to put these

1365
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,460
中文字幕
all on individual paragraphs.

1366
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,560
中文字幕
And the IDE sometimes can be a little annoying

1367
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,110
中文字幕
because now I'm going in retroactively and adding this stuff.

1368
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,280
中文字幕
So it's trying to be helpful.

1369
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,480
中文字幕
But then I have to delete it.

1370
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,570
中文字幕
So sometimes, this autocomplete can get in the way.

1371
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:38,000
中文字幕
But it's an easy enough fix-- open p.

1372
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,320
中文字幕
Let me move this over here and move this over here.

1373
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,100
中文字幕
Save.

1374
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,060
中文字幕
Go back to the browser.

1375
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,550
中文字幕
It's not going to change on its own.

1376
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,010
中文字幕
I need to click Reload.

1377
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,680
中文字幕
And now-- better.

1378
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,750
中文字幕
It's a little ugly-- more whitespace than I want.

1379
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,100
中文字幕
But it's closer, certainly.

1380
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,200
中文字幕
Let's clean up that copyright symbol.

1381
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,090
中文字幕
It turns out there's some keys you just can't type on your keyboard.

1382
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:59,130
中文字幕
You could certainly copy-paste it from elsewhere.

1383
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:02,840
中文字幕
But HTML, as an aside, supports what are called entities.

1384
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,360
中文字幕
And these are numeric codes that are sometimes

1385
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,000
中文字幕
written in hexadecimal, sometimes written in decimal, depending

1386
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,620
中文字幕
on your preference.

1387
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,750
中文字幕
And it's just a weird number that represents a symbol.

1388
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,030
中文字幕
You couldn't, otherwise, type.

1389
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,200
中文字幕
Watch as I reload now.

1390
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,480
中文字幕
So what happens to that copyright symbol?

1391
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,940
中文字幕
Now it's the one you might expect--

1392
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,580
中文字幕
so minor detail.

1393
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,830
中文字幕
It's not all that interesting.

1394
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,980
中文字幕
But those do exist, as well, for aesthetics.

1395
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,360
中文字幕
But this isn't quite what I want.

1396
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,920
中文字幕
And here is where CSS comes in.

1397
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,630
中文字幕
I can lay out the structure of this page.

1398
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,570
中文字幕
Yes, I have my three separate paragraphs.

1399
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:30,930
中文字幕
But they're not centered.

1400
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,600
中文字幕
Their font sizes are all the same.

1401
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,730
中文字幕
And there's weird gaps there.

1402
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:36,870
中文字幕
This is where CSS can help.

1403
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,960
中文字幕
So let me introduce a few new tags instead.

1404
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,420
中文字幕
These aren't strictly paragraphs.

1405
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,010
中文字幕
It's not sentences and sentences of text.

1406
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:45,600
中文字幕
This is kind of like the header of my page.

1407
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,390
中文字幕
So let me actually rename this to header.

1408
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,560
中文字幕
This is maybe the main part of my page.

1409
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,170
中文字幕
So let me rename this to main.

1410
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:53,450
中文字幕
And this is like the footer of my page, I would claim.

1411
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:55,010
中文字幕
Now, it's a super simple website.

1412
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,330
中文字幕
But these tags exist.

1413
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,630
中文字幕
And in the most recent version of HTML called HTML5,

1414
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:04,020
中文字幕
the world has started moving away from generic tags, like p for paragraph,

1415
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:08,150
中文字幕
to more semantic tags that are a little more descriptive that say,

1416
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:11,030
中文字幕
hey, browser, here's the header of my page, annoyingly,

1417
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,090
中文字幕
not to be confused with the head of your page, which is, like, the title.

1418
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:16,210
中文字幕
And, hey, browser, here's the main part of my page.

1419
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,480
中文字幕
Here's the footer of my page.

1420
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,430
中文字幕
And we'll see why this is useful, if only

1421
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,460
中文字幕
because it describes my page a little more compellingly.

1422
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,610
中文字幕
But it turns out that any HTML tag can have a style

1423
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,530
中文字幕
attribute, which we've not seen before.

1424
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:33,140
中文字幕
And if I want to alter the font size of this tag, I can say, make this large.

1425
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:39,200
中文字幕
And down here, I can say, style equals font-size, let's say, medium.

1426
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,720
中文字幕
And then down here, I can say style equals font-size small.

1427
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,040
中文字幕
And let me save that, go back to the browser, reload.

1428
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,300
中文字幕
And it's not centered yet.

1429
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,460
中文字幕
But now it's kind of big, medium--

1430
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,620
中文字幕
large, medium, and small, which is what I intended the first time.

1431
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,410
中文字幕
So how can I actually add centering?

1432
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,020
中文字幕
Well, it turns out inside of these quotes,

1433
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,870
中文字幕
you can use semicolons to separate multiple ideas.

1434
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:07,760
中文字幕
If I put a semicolon here, I can now say, text-align center.

1435
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,020
中文字幕
And let me go ahead and copy and paste that here and here.

1436
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:12,920
中文字幕
Save.

1437
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,120
中文字幕
And notice the pattern.

1438
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,770
中文字幕
There's a keyword, a colon, and then a value.

1439
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,370
中文字幕
A semicolon separates it.

1440
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:22,070
中文字幕
Then there's a keyword, a colon, and a value.

1441
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:24,080
中文字幕
That's the same pattern we're going to see.

1442
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,200
中文字幕
If I go back to the browser, reload now, now we're on our way.

1443
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,150
中文字幕
Now it looks more like what I intended it to look like.

1444
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,560
中文字幕
It took a little more effort.

1445
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,380
中文字幕
But thanks to CSS, I was able to do it.

1446
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,610
中文字幕
So what I've highlighted here and what the IDE has highlighted in green

1447
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:42,170
中文字幕
is what are called CSS properties, Cascading Style Sheets.

1448
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:46,260
中文字幕
CSS lets you deal with things like centering and font sizes

1449
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,700
中文字幕
and colors and positioning and all the aesthetics I alluded to earlier.

1450
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,870
中文字幕
And you just have to know what these key values are.

1451
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:53,750
中文字幕
Honestly, I don't know all of them, certainly.

1452
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,350
中文字幕
I always Google when I want to know how could I

1453
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,910
中文字幕
do something with this type of tag.

1454
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,800
中文字幕
That's because there's a lot of online free references

1455
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,840
中文字幕
that just shows you this.

1456
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,470
中文字幕
But they all follow the same pattern--

1457
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:06,420
中文字幕
key, colon, value-- maybe semicolon-- key, colon, value, and so forth.

1458
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,760
中文字幕
But even if you've never written HTML before,

1459
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,270
中文字幕
you could probably argue that I am not making--

1460
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:14,490
中文字幕
designing this very well.

1461
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:20,160
中文字幕
In C, too, you might have found fault any time my instinct was to copy-paste.

1462
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,460
中文字幕
What is redundant in this example?

1463
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,620
中文字幕
Yeah.

1464
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,660
中文字幕
I'm centering all three, which honestly, it just looks a little stupid.

1465
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,280
中文字幕
It literally was copied and pasted.

1466
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,320
中文字幕
And that should always rub you the wrong way.

1467
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,820
中文字幕
So Cascading Style Sheets--

1468
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,110
中文字幕
the first C in Cascading Style Sheets, or the only C

1469
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,660
中文字幕
in Cascading Style Sheets, stands for Cascading,

1470
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,370
中文字幕
which implies a hierarchy to it, too.

1471
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:44,040
中文字幕
So let me, actually, make a new example.

1472
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,880
中文字幕
Let me call this css1.html.

1473
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,650
中文字幕
Let me paste that same exact code.

1474
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:55,720
中文字幕
But it occurs to me that header and main and footer are all children of body,

1475
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,290
中文字幕
if you will.

1476
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,390
中文字幕
They're indented inside.

1477
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,910
中文字幕
And you can-- you actually can use family tree references

1478
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:02,970
中文字幕
in the context of HTML, where header is a child

1479
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:07,240
中文字幕
of body insofar as it's inside of her, tucked, indented, inside of it.

1480
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,200
中文字幕
So if these all have the same parent, so to speak,

1481
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,920
中文字幕
let me actually erase this from all three tags.

1482
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,670
中文字幕
And let me actually apply it to the parent tag, saying,

1483
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:22,380
中文字幕
style equals text-align center because cascading

1484
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,270
中文字幕
style sheets, indeed, cascade.

1485
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:28,770
中文字幕
So if you apply one property, like aligning in the center, to the parent,

1486
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:32,220
中文字幕
it's going to cascade down on all of the children nested inside.

1487
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,920
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and save this, go back to the listing,

1488
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,860
中文字幕
and open up css1.html.

1489
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:40,290
中文字幕
And voila-- no aesthetic difference.

1490
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:43,530
中文字幕
But it's just better designed, like 5 out of 5 for design

1491
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:49,650
中文字幕
now, but not necessarily because this is a little ugly, honestly.

1492
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,570
中文字幕
And we've not had occasion to do this yet in C

1493
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:53,850
中文字幕
because we only had one language in C. It, generally,

1494
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:59,350
中文字幕
is frowned upon to combine one language, like CSS, with another, like HTML.

1495
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,900
中文字幕
And they might look very similar.

1496
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,980
中文字幕
And they're all in the same context.

1497
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:02,760
中文字幕
But this gets annoying.

1498
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,200
中文字幕
And especially in the real world, some people

1499
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,700
中文字幕
might be better with aesthetics than others.

1500
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,050
中文字幕
Clearly, from my examples, I'm not among those people.

1501
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,630
中文字幕
And so I might want to work with a colleague or a friend who's

1502
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:13,330
中文字幕
much better at design and colors and fonts than I am.

1503
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,370
中文字幕
And so I might want them to work independently of me.

1504
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,920
中文字幕
I'll work on the structure of the web page or, if you will, my final project,

1505
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,680
中文字幕
and let them actually contribute more of the aesthetics.

1506
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,890
中文字幕
So how can we begin to decouple these things?

1507
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,990
中文字幕
Much like in C, we, at least, had header files.

1508
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,250
中文字幕
We could factor out commonalities.

1509
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:32,850
中文字幕
Well, it turns out we can do this a little differently from before.

1510
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:39,680
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and open up an example 2 that I made earlier called css2.html.

1511
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,670
中文字幕
And let's scroll through this for just a moment.

1512
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:47,540
中文字幕
Notice now that in the body of this web page, I've introduced a different tag--

1513
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,140
中文字幕
rather, a different attribute called "class."

1514
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,630
中文字幕
So it turns out that you don't have to just copy and paste or type out

1515
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,380
中文字幕
manually all of these nit-picky font size changes and text alignment

1516
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:58,970
中文字幕
changes.

1517
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:01,170
中文字幕
You can give them more descriptive names.

1518
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,200
中文字幕
And arguably, it's a lot more readable to me and my partner

1519
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,220
中文字幕
to read the word "centered" and "large" and "medium" and "small"

1520
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:11,850
中文字幕
and not see all the stupid colons and the semicolons and the distractions.

1521
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:15,810
中文字幕
That's the stuff that's not interesting when writing any sort of code.

1522
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,960
中文字幕
So where did these words come from-- centered, large, medium, and small?

1523
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,930
中文字幕
Well, notice that they're all values of a class attribute, which

1524
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,590
中文字幕
is-- allows for customization.

1525
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:28,680
中文字幕
Let me scroll up to the head of my web page.

1526
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,100
中文字幕
And you'll see, and it's mostly whitespace because I just

1527
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,910
中文字幕
kept hitting Enter to clean it up--

1528
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:36,720
中文字幕
notice that inside of my html tag is, as before, my head tag.

1529
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,720
中文字幕
If I scroll down, there's also still a title tag.

1530
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,850
中文字幕
But there's a new tag that I alluded to earlier among the few

1531
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:45,000
中文字幕
you can put up there called "style."

1532
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,520
中文字幕
You can factor out to the top of your page

1533
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,080
中文字幕
all of the stylizations that you care about.

1534
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,630
中文字幕
And you can do it as follows.

1535
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:55,320
中文字幕
Notice here that I've literally written the word "centered" with a dot in front

1536
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,840
中文字幕
of it, the word "large" with a dot in front of it,

1537
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,910
中文字幕
the word "medium" with a dot, "small" with a dot.

1538
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:02,040
中文字幕
Those define classes.

1539
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,460
中文字幕
So CSS lets you define your own collections

1540
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:06,910
中文字幕
of configuration properties.

1541
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:09,210
中文字幕
And you can give them names, just so it's a little more

1542
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,780
中文字幕
descriptive and user-friendly.

1543
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,960
中文字幕
So you can define class, class, class, class.

1544
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,620
中文字幕
And then inside the curly braces, which I've lined up here, just like in C,

1545
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:20,430
中文字幕
you can have one property, two properties, 100 properties.

1546
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:24,180
中文字幕
But you can keep them nice and orderly, away from all of your HTML, so

1547
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:27,150
中文字幕
that someone else can work on them or just you can keep the aesthetics

1548
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:28,900
中文字幕
separate from the contents of your page.

1549
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,720
中文字幕
It's the notion of separation of concerns.

1550
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,680
中文字幕
Keep the data separate from the presentation thereof.

1551
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,730
中文字幕
Is there a library you can use that's done this for you?

1552
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,230
中文字幕
Yes.

1553
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,650
中文字幕
And we'll see a little teaser for that in just a bit.

1554
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,190
中文字幕
So where are I using these words, to be clear?

1555
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:46,530
中文字幕
Here, I'm saying give me a class called centered,

1556
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,560
中文字幕
a class called large, medium, and small, each of which

1557
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,180
中文字幕
have these respective properties associated with them.

1558
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,270
中文字幕
And then down here, I can just use those words.

1559
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,980
中文字幕
And I don't have to get into the business

1560
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:01,200
中文字幕
of the semicolons, curly braces, and all of that in my actual HTML.

1561
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,130
中文字幕
But it turns out I can do this even more fancily.

1562
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:10,150
中文字幕
Let me open up css3.html, another example.

1563
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:11,880
中文字幕
In this case, notice what I've done.

1564
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,540
中文字幕
Now my code is really getting pretty, relatively speaking,

1565
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,720
中文字幕
or from one person's perspective.

1566
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,670
中文字幕
Now I don't have any attributes.

1567
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:21,840
中文字幕
This is just tighter.

1568
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,990
中文字幕
I'm using fewer characters, fewer words, fewer lines of code.

1569
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,700
中文字幕
This is just, generally, a good thing.

1570
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,330
中文字幕
It's less work.

1571
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,300
中文字幕
It's less to maintain, fewer opportunities for mistakes.

1572
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,210
中文字幕
But I've gotten rid of, it seems, all of the aesthetics,

1573
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:37,350
中文字幕
but not necessarily, because CSS, this second language,

1574
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:41,820
中文字幕
also lets you apply properties not to tags by way of classes,

1575
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:44,200
中文字幕
but to the actual tags themselves.

1576
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:50,070
中文字幕
So if you only have one body, it is safe to say, OK, CSS, apply to the body tag

1577
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,610
中文字幕
this or these properties.

1578
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:55,080
中文字幕
Hey, browser, apply to the header tag this or these properties--

1579
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,640
中文字幕
to the main tag, the footer tag, and so forth.

1580
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,570
中文字幕
So I don't even need to complicate my world with small, medium, large,

1581
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,110
中文字幕
and so forth.

1582
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:04,020
中文字幕
I can just apply those properties at the top of my file

1583
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,210
中文字幕
to the respective tag names, whatever they are.

1584
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:07,440
中文字幕
And I could use the p tag.

1585
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,390
中文字幕
I could use the image tag, the a tag, any of those.

1586
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,220
中文字幕
I can style them in different ways.

1587
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,840
中文字幕
In fact, if you wondered or started to wonder how could you resize an image,

1588
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,510
中文字幕
you can apply CSS to the image tag and say,

1589
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:22,490
中文字幕
make it this many pixels or this many pixels, or something like that.

1590
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:22,990
中文字幕
Yeah?

1591
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:31,630
中文字幕
Is it bad design to then keep pushing 

1592
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:35,310
中文字幕
Yes.

1593
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:38,340
中文字幕
Is it not bad design to just keep adding more stuff to the top

1594
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,410
中文字幕
and pushing your actual content down and down

1595
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,090
中文字幕
and down and just bloating the file?

1596
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:46,230
中文字幕
Yes-- which is a wonderful segue to our fourth and final example here, which

1597
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,480
中文字幕
is css4.html.

1598
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,520
中文字幕
This example-- let me just zoom out.

1599
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,780
中文字幕
That's it.

1600
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:58,020
中文字幕
This css4.html has even fewer lines of code and, indeed, no CSS in it

1601
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,950
中文字幕
whatsoever.

1602
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:02,640
中文字幕
This is just the website I care about, the words and the data I care about.

1603
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,010
中文字幕
All of the aesthetic stuff, while important,

1604
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:13,580
中文字幕
is relegated to a separate file that you can probably infer is called css4.css.

1605
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:17,420
中文字幕
Unfortunately, and this was a stupid design decision by humans years ago,

1606
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:21,890
中文字幕
the way you include CSS from a separate file

1607
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:26,090
中文字幕
is, paradoxically, to use a link tag, not the a tag,

1608
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:28,670
中文字幕
which probably should have been called the link tag.

1609
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,960
中文字幕
But you have a relationship of style sheet.

1610
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,440
中文字幕
So sometimes, humans make poor decisions.

1611
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,940
中文字幕
This is one of them, I would say.

1612
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,180
中文字幕
But if you just copy-paste and trust that this means, hey, browser,

1613
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:42,800
中文字幕
open up this file and use those features from the file in this file,

1614
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,280
中文字幕
it's similar, in spirit, to C's hash include mechanism.

1615
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,880
中文字幕
It just looks a little different.

1616
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,910
中文字幕
So what's in that file?

1617
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:52,670
中文字幕
Well, you can probably guess, if I go into css4.css,

1618
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,840
中文字幕
it's just that same content.

1619
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,170
中文字幕
But I factored it out, as you notes-- wasn't the best design to keep it

1620
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,010
中文字幕
all together.

1621
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,940
中文字幕
So I can simply put it there instead.

1622
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,990
中文字幕
Any questions?

1623
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:06,210
中文字幕
Yeah?

1624
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:10,950
中文字幕
In the other one, the fourth perfect one, the best one,

1625
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:13,020
中文字幕
what does "stylesheet" do?

1626
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,270
中文字幕
Good question.

1627
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:15,930
中文字幕
What does stylesheet do in this example?

1628
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:18,990
中文字幕
Short answer is that just makes clear to the browser

1629
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:24,970
中文字幕
that the relationship between this file, css4.css, and this file,

1630
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:27,840
中文字幕
which is the HTML file, is that of a "style sheet."

1631
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,780
中文字幕
So CSS, Cascading Style Sheets-- it's a lot of words

1632
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,430
中文字幕
just to convey the idea of aesthetics.

1633
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,510
中文字幕
But that is your style sheet, literally.

1634
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:39,540
中文字幕
It's an actual file that ends in .css that should be applied to this HTML.

1635
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,040
中文字幕
Yeah?

1636
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,660
中文字幕
Better design why?

1637
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,480
中文字幕
It's really good question.

1638
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,090
中文字幕
So to summarize, is it-- isn't it--

1639
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:59,380
中文字幕
wouldn't that be better design, to have one file with your HTML and your CSS,

1640
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:01,430
中文字幕
rather than two because things can get misplaced?

1641
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,450
中文字幕
Now they're decoupled.

1642
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:03,970
中文字幕
There's not the same inherent link.

1643
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:04,950
中文字幕
Maybe, honestly.

1644
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,160
中文字幕
That is a reasonable concern.

1645
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,880
中文字幕
Reasonable people will disagree.

1646
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,490
中文字幕
Generally, I would say that the programming

1647
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:13,310
中文字幕
world has decided that separation of concerns is a good thing.

1648
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:16,400
中文字幕
So keep your HTML in one file, your CSS in another file.

1649
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,900
中文字幕
Keep them in the same folder.

1650
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,700
中文字幕
And, frankly, if you go losing your files in a folder all the time,

1651
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,820
中文字幕
the problem is probably a--

1652
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,960
中文字幕
is human problem, not a technical one.

1653
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,310
中文字幕
But you make a good point, too.

1654
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:29,100
中文字幕
And you could argue, quite credibly, that you're just over-engineering this

1655
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:29,600
中文字幕
now.

1656
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,070
中文字幕
I like it better altogether.

1657
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:34,310
中文字幕
And you'll see in CS50's website and Facebook and Google and others--

1658
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:36,980
中文字幕
sometimes, you do see CSS together with HTML

1659
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:39,390
中文字幕
because humans decided this does make more sense.

1660
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:43,370
中文字幕
But there are these mechanisms in place to facilitate collaboration,

1661
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:47,570
中文字幕
to facilitate separation, so that you can keep things a little more organized

1662
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:49,910
中文字幕
in separate files.

1663
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:52,390
中文字幕
Any questions then?

1664
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:56,150
中文字幕
So to recap where we're at, because this is a lot quickly,

1665
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:59,730
中文字幕
HTTP is this protocol via which you can just exchange information

1666
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:03,510
中文字幕
from A to B and B to A. HTML is the language in which web pages are

1667
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:06,780
中文字幕
written, that structure of the web page, and actually have your data.

1668
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,940
中文字幕
And CSS lets you fine-tune it.

1669
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,690
中文字幕
Now, I didn't fine-tune it all that much.

1670
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,570
中文字幕
I just centered it and changed the font size.

1671
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:15,190
中文字幕
But honestly, we can very quickly get into the weeds of colors

1672
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,530
中文字幕
and positioning and all of that.

1673
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:20,220
中文字幕
But that we'll do in sections and in Psets and in googling and looking

1674
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,930
中文字幕
at online references that we'll point you

1675
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:27,030
中文字幕
to because it just all follows the same patterns of tags with attributes

1676
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,380
中文字幕
and then CSS properties.

1677
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:31,650
中文字幕
So even though you've not seen the whole vocabulary of CSS and HTML,

1678
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:35,800
中文字幕
you have seen the entire structure, the fundamental concepts.

1679
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,360
中文字幕
So let's introduce then one final piece of the puzzle

1680
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,790
中文字幕
and bring back to bear some of our programming

1681
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:44,670
中文字幕
capabilities of the past several weeks.

1682
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:49,890
中文字幕
So it turns out that in the world of HTML and CSS,

1683
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:53,670
中文字幕
you can actually introduce a programming language, as well,

1684
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:57,780
中文字幕
to make your websites even more dynamic using something called JavaScript.

1685
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,000
中文字幕
Many of you have taken APCS and know Java--

1686
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,110
中文字幕
no relation.

1687
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:03,810
中文字幕
JavaScript was just a marketing decision to them--

1688
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,210
中文字幕
call it something similar to an already popular language.

1689
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:11,160
中文字幕
So JavaScript is a language used in browsers, typically,

1690
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,820
中文字幕
to give you more control over the users' experience.

1691
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:18,120
中文字幕
For instance, when you visit Gmail these days and you get a new mail,

1692
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,600
中文字幕
it just appears magically as a new row in your inbox.

1693
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,810
中文字幕
You don't have to reload or keep clicking Refresh to see your new mail.

1694
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:26,910
中文字幕
It just appears magically.

1695
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,920
中文字幕
When you're using Google Maps or something,

1696
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,260
中文字幕
you can just click and drag and see more of the map.

1697
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,510
中文字幕
Back in my day, you have to click a right arrow

1698
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,560
中文字幕
to go this way, a left arrow to go that way.

1699
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,950
中文字幕
And the whole web page would actually reload.

1700
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,940
中文字幕
But JavaScript gives you logic and programming capabilities

1701
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:46,860
中文字幕
in your users' Macs and PCs and phones that gets executed not on your server,

1702
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:51,360
中文字幕
but on their browser, which means you can do many more things by running code

1703
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,900
中文字幕
on their computers.

1704
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,340
中文字幕
So what does this actually mean?

1705
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,490
中文字幕
Well, in JavaScript, fortunately, we have

1706
01:17:56,490 --> 01:18:00,120
中文字幕
a language that's super similar to C. But it's interpreted top

1707
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,600
中文字幕
to bottom, left to right.

1708
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,650
中文字幕
The browser just reads the instructions in JavaScript and just does them.

1709
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,020
中文字幕
There's no compilation for you.

1710
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,210
中文字幕
There's no zeros and ones.

1711
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:09,870
中文字幕
And so in that sense, it's just easier than C.

1712
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:15,660
中文字幕
Also, it has no pointers, which also makes it easier than C.

1713
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:19,030
中文字幕
But it gives us the ability to alter a web page

1714
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,850
中文字幕
once it's been delivered to a user.

1715
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:23,310
中文字幕
And we'll see what we can actually do with that capability.

1716
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:24,710
中文字幕
But first, let's compare and contrast.

1717
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:27,510
中文字幕
You'll recall a few weeks ago, in week 1, when we introduced C,

1718
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,970
中文字幕
we pulled up some Scratch we pulled up some C, just to show

1719
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:31,590
中文字幕
that the ideas are still the same.

1720
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,240
中文字幕
Let's do the same real quick here.

1721
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,080
中文字幕
So we went from Scratch to C. Let's now go to JavaScript with variables.

1722
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,340
中文字幕
So in C, if you wanted to set a counter to 0 a la Scratch,

1723
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,920
中文字幕
you would literally say counter equals 0, semicolon.

1724
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,260
中文字幕
But you would have the data type to the left.

1725
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,690
中文字幕
In JavaScript, the code is almost the same.

1726
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,880
中文字幕
But you actually don't specify data types.

1727
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,570
中文字幕
You, the programmer, don't worry about ints or floats or strings

1728
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:55,500
中文字幕
or all of that.

1729
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,180
中文字幕
You do define the variable.

1730
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,820
中文字幕
And the keyword to use, though there's several options that

1731
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,590
中文字幕
do slightly different things, is let.

1732
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:06,480
中文字幕
Add the thinking is let the counter equal 0, please, if you will.

1733
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,450
中文字幕
But you don't specify the type, even though JavaScript supports

1734
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:11,790
中文字幕
numbers and strings, and so forth.

1735
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:14,340
中文字幕
You just don't have to care about them as much anymore.

1736
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:15,960
中文字幕
Suppose you want to update a variable.

1737
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,780
中文字幕
In Scratch, you would just change the counter by one.

1738
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:22,800
中文字幕
In C, you would do counter equals counter plus 1, semicolon.

1739
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,560
中文字幕
In JavaScript, you would do the exact same thing.

1740
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,060
中文字幕
Code is identical.

1741
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,580
中文字幕
In C, you could also write this more succinctly

1742
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,060
中文字幕
as counter plus equals 1, semicolon, if you recall.

1743
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,150
中文字幕
If you don't, that's fine.

1744
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:35,070
中文字幕
This is just shorthand notation.

1745
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,560
中文字幕
In JavaScript-- same exact thing.

1746
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,810
中文字幕
In C, you could also do counter plus, plus,

1747
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,580
中文字幕
semicolon to increment the value--

1748
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,290
中文字幕
in JavaScript, same.

1749
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:45,210
中文字幕
So this is what's nice about JavaScript.

1750
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:47,670
中文字幕
You already know much of it just by nature

1751
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:50,670
中文字幕
of having spent so many weeks in the weeds with C.

1752
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:54,870
中文字幕
Suppose you had an if condition, like this-- is if x is less than y.

1753
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:56,850
中文字幕
In C, we would write it like this at right.

1754
01:19:56,850 --> 01:19:59,130
中文字幕
JavaScript syntax is the same.

1755
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:02,070
中文字幕
If you had an if-else, syntax is the same.

1756
01:20:02,070 --> 01:20:03,480
中文字幕
If else, if else--

1757
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,670
中文字幕
syntax is the same.

1758
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:09,550
中文字幕
If you want a forever loop, syntax is the same, while true.

1759
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:15,010
中文字幕
If you want a for loop, syntax is almost the same.

1760
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,790
中文字幕
Let needs to be used instead.

1761
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:20,680
中文字幕
So this is C because it says int i equals 0, and so forth.

1762
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:21,810
中文字幕
That's a data type.

1763
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:24,430
中文字幕
JavaScript-- I just claim doesn't worry--

1764
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:26,660
中文字幕
you don't need to worry about those data types.

1765
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:29,530
中文字幕
So in JavaScript, you would instead say "let" instead.

1766
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:32,150
中文字幕
But otherwise, the syntax is the same.

1767
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:34,360
中文字幕
So that's a nice starting point because there's

1768
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,250
中文字幕
nothing new to learn syntactically.

1769
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:39,430
中文字幕
We just need to apply the same logic that we saw in week 0 and 1

1770
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,620
中文字幕
since to HTML.

1771
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:45,010
中文字幕
So if this is a representative web page, albeit super simple--

1772
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,600
中文字幕
this is the one I brought up earlier--

1773
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,000
中文字幕
how can we now start thinking about this web page

1774
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,300
中文字幕
in a way that is conducive to programming it

1775
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,610
中文字幕
and actually changing it dynamically?

1776
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:59,980
中文字幕
Well, let me propose that you think of this same web page as just a tree.

1777
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:03,210
中文字幕
And we introduced trees just a week ago, albeit in the context of C.

1778
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:05,260
中文字幕
And frankly, in C, they're a headache because you

1779
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:09,100
中文字幕
have to wire things together using pointers and nodes and all of that.

1780
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,480
中文字幕
Don't worry about that now.

1781
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,290
中文字幕
It's the browser's job to build this in memory or RAM for you.

1782
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:16,840
中文字幕
And indeed, when I keep saying that a browser, upon receiving

1783
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,880
中文字幕
an envelope with HTML, reads it top to bottom, left to right,

1784
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,380
中文字幕
I haven't said what it does with it.

1785
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:24,760
中文字幕
What it essentially does with it is it creates this data structure

1786
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,230
中文字幕
in memory for you.

1787
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:30,520
中文字幕
And it is Chrome or Edge or Firefox or whatever browser you're using that

1788
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,480
中文字幕
itself is written in probably C or C++ or some other language.

1789
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,270
中文字幕
Some other human at those companies wrote the code

1790
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:40,120
中文字幕
that builds all of the pointers and/or whatever is

1791
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,490
中文字幕
used to build this structure in memory.

1792
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:46,870
中文字幕
But this is what the browser has in mind once it's read your HTML.

1793
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:49,390
中文字幕
And now that it's a data structure in memory,

1794
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:51,400
中文字幕
you can make changes to it, just like last week,

1795
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,580
中文字幕
we were inserting humans into our linked list, changing the data structure.

1796
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:59,470
中文字幕
The browser can add more nodes or more tags to the page, dynamically.

1797
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:01,960
中文字幕
So if you run with this in your mind, when

1798
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,060
中文字幕
you get a new email in Gmail, what is happening?

1799
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:07,750
中文字幕
Well, the web page, when you first load it in Gmail,

1800
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:12,550
中文字幕
has a whole bunch of td tags, probably, or tr tags, rather, for table row--

1801
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:15,940
中文字幕
table row, table row-- each of which represents an email, perhaps.

1802
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:21,700
中文字幕
When you get a new email, the browser is probably just adding another tr node

1803
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,320
中文字幕
to this tree because notice the words here.

1804
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,870
中文字幕
Html lines up with this tag.

1805
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:27,460
中文字幕
Head lines up with this tag.

1806
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:29,200
中文字幕
Body lines up with this tag.

1807
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,050
中文字幕
So it stands to reason that when you get another row in your inbox

1808
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:36,460
中文字幕
with another email, someone is just adding a node to that tree.

1809
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:39,940
中文字幕
And that someone is JavaScript, the language

1810
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:44,320
中文字幕
in which you can control the users' browser even after they've loaded

1811
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,950
中文字幕
your web page for the first time.

1812
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:47,500
中文字幕
So what can we actually do with this?

1813
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,580
中文字幕
Let's start simple, as follows.

1814
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:57,250
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and just whip up, really quickly, a file called hello0.html.

1815
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:01,220
中文字幕
And we'll do it, as before, with our DOCTYPE html--

1816
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,820
中文字幕
my html tag here, my head tag here.

1817
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:06,160
中文字幕
My title here will be hello0.

1818
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,680
中文字幕
And notice I've been moving these to separate lines.

1819
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,350
中文字幕
You don't strictly need to do that-- just to keep the hierarchy.

1820
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:13,150
中文字幕
The whitespace, again doesn't matter.

1821
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,440
中文字幕
But I'll be consistent there.

1822
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:18,140
中文字幕
And in my body here, I'll say this time just "hello, world" by default.

1823
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:20,500
中文字幕
So that's a pretty simple web page as well.

1824
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,810
中文字幕
Let's, actually, now make it interactive.

1825
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,290
中文字幕
All of my web pages thus far have been static content,

1826
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:26,380
中文字幕
except for the Google one.

1827
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:29,950
中文字幕
But even that wasn't so much interactive as it was the moment I hit Submit,

1828
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:32,650
中文字幕
it made the problem Google's problem to deal with.

1829
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:34,610
中文字幕
Let's keep the user with me this time.

1830
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:36,190
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and do this.

1831
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:38,290
中文字幕
Let me get rid of this form here.

1832
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:43,300
中文字幕
Let me create a new file now called hello1 as my next version.

1833
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,190
中文字幕
And let me go ahead and paste that same code.

1834
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:49,750
中文字幕
But this time, let me have the browser be a little interactive.

1835
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:54,580
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and have a form here because what I want is a text box--

1836
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,300
中文字幕
type equals text.

1837
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,180
中文字幕
I'm not going to bother giving it a name yet.

1838
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,090
中文字幕
And let me have another one called type equals submit.

1839
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,500
中文字幕
Save.

1840
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:07,150
中文字幕
And let me go ahead and open up my server so I can see this file.

1841
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:11,020
中文字幕
This, I said, was what-- hello1.html.

1842
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:12,470
中文字幕
So it's just a simple form.

1843
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,470
中文字幕
But there's no connection to Google this time.

1844
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,600
中文字幕
Let me start to use this form interactively

1845
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,310
中文字幕
because if I have the ability to program,

1846
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:21,200
中文字幕
I bet I could take the users' input and do something with it.

1847
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,630
中文字幕
So how do I do this?

1848
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:27,750
中文字幕
Well, let me propose first that I want the human to type

1849
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:28,840
中文字幕
their name into this form.

1850
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,130
中文字幕
And then when they click Submit, I want it

1851
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:32,800
中文字幕
to say "hello, David" or "hello, Veronica" or "hello, Brian,"

1852
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,770
中文字幕
whatever the name actually is, like some of our C examples.

1853
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,690
中文字幕
So you know what?

1854
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:39,100
中文字幕
Let me write that function first.

1855
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,380
中文字幕
It turns out that in the head of your web page,

1856
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,440
中文字幕
you can have not just the title and not just style,

1857
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:48,710
中文字幕
but also a tag called script for JavaScript, for instance.

1858
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:50,920
中文字幕
And in this tag, I can actually write code.

1859
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,230
中文字幕
And there's something a little different in JavaScript.

1860
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:57,670
中文字幕
Instead of writing void greet as the name of my function

1861
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:00,190
中文字幕
and then writing the body of my function here and then

1862
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:03,320
中文字幕
saying void here, for instance, JavaScript's a little looser.

1863
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,200
中文字幕
If you don't want to take any arguments, just

1864
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,120
中文字幕
don't mention them-- no mention of void.

1865
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,440
中文字幕
If you don't have a--

1866
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,540
中文字幕
and actually, don't even mention a return type.

1867
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,500
中文字幕
Just call it a function-- so slight difference

1868
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,240
中文字幕
from C. It's a little lazier.

1869
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,710
中文字幕
You don't worry about input types.

1870
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,160
中文字幕
You don't worry about output types.

1871
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,430
中文字幕
You just say, give me a function called greet.

1872
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:21,590
中文字幕
Well, what do I want this function to do?

1873
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:24,260
中文字幕
Turns out in JavaScript, there's a function called alert

1874
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,230
中文字幕
that's just going to pop up a window that says something in it.

1875
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:30,210
中文字幕
And I can pass, as an argument to this JavaScript function,

1876
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:31,580
中文字幕
whatever it is I want it to say.

1877
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:36,490
中文字幕
So let's go ahead and say "hello, world," semicolon.

1878
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:40,010
中文字幕
It's almost identical to C, again, except that I'm saying

1879
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,770
中文字幕
function instead of a return type.

1880
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:43,130
中文字幕
And alert, apparently, exists.

1881
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:46,910
中文字幕
And there's no sharp include or any of that that we typically had in C.

1882
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:49,760
中文字幕
It's just literally in my browser right now.

1883
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,760
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and save that and go down to the form tag here.

1884
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,820
中文字幕
And it turns out, on the form tag, there's

1885
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:58,220
中文字幕
a special attribute called onsubmit.

1886
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:01,610
中文字幕
And as the word implies, it says when the form

1887
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:08,120
中文字幕
is submitted, on the submission of this form, go ahead and execute this, greet.

1888
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,720
中文字幕
So I can actually tell the browser, on submission of this form,

1889
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,210
中文字幕
to call a function that I wrote.

1890
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,760
中文字幕
And now let me just preemptively write return

1891
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,950
中文字幕
false for reasons we'll come back to in a moment,

1892
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,870
中文字幕
just to make sure this actually works.

1893
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:27,920
中文字幕
Now let me go ahead and save this, go to hello1.html, open that up.

1894
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,130
中文字幕
And let me just change the title, for consistency--

1895
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:32,540
中文字幕
so hello1.html.

1896
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:35,630
中文字幕
And let me go ahead and say David, Submit--

1897
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:39,080
中文字幕
hello, world-- not really sure what the point of typing my name was.

1898
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,290
中文字幕
But it, at least, seems to work as programmed.

1899
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:46,080
中文字幕
But obviously, where I'm going with this is I want to display my name.

1900
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,970
中文字幕
So when the human has typed in their name to the box and clicked Submit,

1901
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:51,800
中文字幕
that's triggering a submission of the form.

1902
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,400
中文字幕
But wait.

1903
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,380
中文字幕
When the form is submitted, I'm calling greet.

1904
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:57,650
中文字幕
So it sounds like it's greet's job to figure out what

1905
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:00,180
中文字幕
the word is that the human typed in.

1906
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,120
中文字幕
So how can I do this?

1907
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,040
中文字幕
It's a little cryptic.

1908
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,200
中文字幕
And this is where now it becomes JavaScript-specific

1909
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:08,130
中文字幕
and not C. Let me go ahead and define a variable called name.

1910
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:12,150
中文字幕
And let me use this fancy technique, document.querySelector.

1911
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:18,890
中文字幕
And then in here, I'm going to need to specify

1912
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,630
中文字幕
what node in the tree I want to select.

1913
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,640
中文字幕
So I'm actually getting ahead of myself.

1914
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,160
中文字幕
Let's look at the HTML.

1915
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:30,020
中文字幕
At the moment, I've got a form tag and two input tags, neither of which

1916
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:30,710
中文字幕
has a name.

1917
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,740
中文字幕
And I could fix that.

1918
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,620
中文字幕
But let me actually do a different technique.

1919
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,230
中文字幕
HTML also supports unique identifiers.

1920
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:39,200
中文字幕
And you can give them literally that, unique IDs.

1921
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,860
中文字幕
You can call it whatever you want-- foobar, baz, xyz.

1922
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:43,900
中文字幕
I'm going to make it more descriptive and call it

1923
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,810
中文字幕
ID equals name because what I can now do up here

1924
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:51,800
中文字幕
in querySelector is actually specify what

1925
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,770
中文字幕
it is I want to select from the tree.

1926
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:59,300
中文字幕
That tree is called a DOM, or Document Object Model, verbosely.

1927
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:01,560
中文字幕
And I need to do one last thing-- turns out,

1928
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,440
中文字幕
and you would only know this from experience,

1929
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,860
中文字幕
that if "name" is the unique identifier of an element

1930
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:11,120
中文字幕
and not the name of a tag, I actually need to prefix it with a hash,

1931
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,410
中文字幕
unrelated to C's hash.

1932
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:16,010
中文字幕
But otherwise, this function, querySelector,

1933
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:18,680
中文字幕
is going to think that there's a tag called "name."

1934
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:22,800
中文字幕
So this means an ID whose value is "name."

1935
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,850
中文字幕
It's a bit of a mouthful.

1936
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:24,830
中文字幕
But here we go.

1937
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:29,340
中文字幕
Once I select that node from the tree, I want to get its value and set it--

1938
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:32,750
中文字幕
I want to get its value, semicolon.

1939
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:33,680
中文字幕
What is going on?

1940
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:38,420
中文字幕
First, recall from this tree here that whenever the browser loads HTML,

1941
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,590
中文字幕
it has some HTML.

1942
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:41,660
中文字幕
It builds a tree structure therein.

1943
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:47,210
中文字幕
Each of those nodes is selectable via this function called querySelector.

1944
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:48,110
中文字幕
What is document?

1945
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,810
中文字幕
Well, it turns out in JavaScript, there's

1946
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:51,950
中文字幕
this special global variable called document

1947
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:54,590
中文字幕
that refers to the whole document, the whole web page.

1948
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:58,220
中文字幕
Built into that is a function called querySelector.

1949
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:02,940
中文字幕
That dot notation is reminiscent of C's struct syntax.

1950
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:06,710
中文字幕
So you can think of document as a struct that represents the whole page.

1951
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:09,210
中文字幕
Inside of it is a function, not just data,

1952
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,150
中文字幕
but a function, called querySelector.

1953
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:13,850
中文字幕
You're going to see this all over the place in JavaScript, dots,

1954
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:17,060
中文字幕
because people-- the JavaScript world is much more voluminous than C.

1955
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:21,230
中文字幕
So there's lots of functions inside of other containers or structures.

1956
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:24,020
中文字幕
So with that said, this is just saying, hey, browser,

1957
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:26,930
中文字幕
let me have a variable called name and store

1958
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:31,910
中文字幕
the value of the node that has a unique identifier of name

1959
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:34,310
中文字幕
and get that by using this function, select it.

1960
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:37,100
中文字幕
That grabs the rectangle from the picture

1961
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:40,340
中文字幕
and gives me access to the value that the human typed in.

1962
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:41,510
中文字幕
Now, I'm not done with this.

1963
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:43,520
中文字幕
I need to actually display that value.

1964
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,590
中文字幕
And it's not going to be correct to do this.

1965
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:48,390
中文字幕
Otherwise, I'm just going to see "hello, name."

1966
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:51,860
中文字幕
So there's not this convention, which we had in C. There's

1967
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:52,930
中文字幕
another way to do this.

1968
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:54,890
中文字幕
But I'm going to go ahead and do it as follows.

1969
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,300
中文字幕
I'm just going to use concatenation.

1970
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:01,520
中文字幕
So this is not possible in C. But in JavaScript,

1971
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,760
中文字幕
if you have a string on the left and a string on the right,

1972
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:07,910
中文字幕
using plus will not add them together, which would make no sense.

1973
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:12,360
中文字幕
It will concatenate them, like glue one to the other.

1974
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,110
中文字幕
In C, how would you do this?

1975
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:15,640
中文字幕
It is an utter nightmare.

1976
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,830
中文字幕
In C, how would you do this?

1977
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:20,260
中文字幕
This would be an array of characters on the left that

1978
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:22,030
中文字幕
has a null character at the end.

1979
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:23,920
中文字幕
This would be another array of characters

1980
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,090
中文字幕
on the right with a null character at the end.

1981
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:28,630
中文字幕
Neither is big enough to fit the other as well.

1982
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:31,480
中文字幕
So you'd have to allocate a new array of characters,

1983
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:36,760
中文字幕
copy these in, get rid of the backslash 0, copy these in, keep the backslash 0,

1984
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,270
中文字幕
throw those away.

1985
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:40,180
中文字幕
And then you have concatenated strings.

1986
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:42,010
中文字幕
That is so many damn steps in C. And this

1987
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:46,750
中文字幕
is why no one likes programming in C. And you don't have to do it anymore.

1988
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,210
中文字幕
In JavaScript, just use the plus operator.

1989
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:50,850
中文字幕
That does all of that for you.

1990
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:54,010
中文字幕
But hopefully, you do have an underlying appreciation of what the plus

1991
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:56,000
中文字幕
operator is actually doing underneath the hood

1992
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,090
中文字幕
because the computer is still doing the same work.

1993
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:02,080
中文字幕
The difference is this week onward, we, the human, do less of that work

1994
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,040
中文字幕
ourselves.

1995
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,020
中文字幕
So plus is an abstraction for all of that complexity.

1996
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:09,120
中文字幕
So if I didn't mess this up, let me go ahead and save now.

1997
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:13,780
中文字幕
I'll go to the browser, reload, and type in my name, David.

1998
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:14,900
中文字幕
Submit.

1999
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:15,820
中文字幕
And there we have it--

2000
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:16,810
中文字幕
hello, David.

2001
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:17,950
中文字幕
Let's do one more test.

2002
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:19,780
中文字幕
We'll try, say, Veronica.

2003
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:20,860
中文字幕
Submit.

2004
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:21,730
中文字幕
And voila.

2005
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:24,280
中文字幕
You'll notice that it's trying to be helpful now, my browser.

2006
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,700
中文字幕
If I start D, then it sees autocomplete, or V--

2007
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,690
中文字幕
well, forgot about Veronica, apparently.

2008
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:32,340
中文字幕
Veronica-- let's see if we reload.

2009
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:34,700
中文字幕
V-- that's weird.

2010
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:37,900
中文字幕
Don't tell Veronica Chrome doesn't remember her.

2011
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:41,570
中文字幕
But we can turn that feature off-- is the point--

2012
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,030
中文字幕
by actually doing things like this.

2013
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,980
中文字幕
And you would know this from the online manual.

2014
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:47,440
中文字幕
Autocomplete equals off turns off that feature.

2015
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,210
中文字幕
Autofocus also does something handy.

2016
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:52,060
中文字幕
If you've ever been to a web page and you can just start typing,

2017
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:54,010
中文字幕
Chrome and macOS highlights it in blue.

2018
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:55,630
中文字幕
That just means give focus.

2019
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:56,800
中文字幕
Put the cursor there.

2020
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,050
中文字幕
If you don't have that, the web page starts like this.

2021
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:01,930
中文字幕
And we've all visited websites, and I think my.hardvard's among them,

2022
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:03,730
中文字幕
where you have to stupidly click there just

2023
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:05,180
中文字幕
to start interacting with the page.

2024
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:06,120
中文字幕
That is not necessary.

2025
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,540
中文字幕
That's bad programming.

2026
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,560
中文字幕
Just using the tags can fix that kind of thing.

2027
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,520
中文字幕
Questions?

2028
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:17,720
中文字幕
What if we have two IDs with the same name?

2029
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:18,500
中文字幕
You should not.

2030
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,460
中文字幕
That is human error.

2031
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:21,660
中文字幕
An ID, by definition, must be unique.

2032
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:26,690
中文字幕
And if you have two by the same name, the human messed up.

2033
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:27,520
中文字幕
And what it does--

2034
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,940
中文字幕
I don't know what the behavior is.

2035
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:32,450
中文字幕
It's probably unofficially not documented or maybe it picks the first.

2036
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:33,500
中文字幕
Maybe it picks the last.

2037
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:33,950
中文字幕
I don't know.

2038
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,490
中文字幕
But you shouldn't rely on it, anyway.

2039
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:36,100
中文字幕
Good question.

2040
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:36,830
中文字幕
Good corner case.

2041
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:37,890
中文字幕
Other questions?

2042
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,200
中文字幕
Let me jump ahead to one example.

2043
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,110
中文字幕
And then we'll come back to a fancier version of this.

2044
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:49,330
中文字幕
Let me open up a program that's in today's source 5

2045
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,730
中文字幕
directory called background.html.

2046
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:56,530
中文字幕
It's got some familiar letters, which probably stand for red, green, blue,

2047
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:57,130
中文字幕
probably.

2048
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:58,290
中文字幕
These are three buttons.

2049
01:32:58,290 --> 01:32:59,250
中文字幕
And we've seen buttons.

2050
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:02,650
中文字幕
We saw the Search button and the Submit buttons that I've created before.

2051
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:05,680
中文字幕
But using JavaScript, I can do fun things like this.

2052
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:09,130
中文字幕
If I click on R, the web page just changed.

2053
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:13,030
中文字幕
G, B, R, G, B-- this is now interactive.

2054
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:16,450
中文字幕
If you were just writing HTML and CSS, you'd have to pick one of those colors

2055
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:17,630
中文字幕
and stick with it.

2056
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:19,850
中文字幕
But with JavaScript, you can respond.

2057
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:21,970
中文字幕
And that's because a browser has lots and lots

2058
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:24,130
中文字幕
of events happening all the time.

2059
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:30,550
中文字幕
Events include clicks or mice moving or dragging or, in a mobile device,

2060
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:31,240
中文字幕
touching.

2061
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,450
中文字幕
So there's lots of things that a human can be doing with a web browser.

2062
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:38,710
中文字幕
And you can write code that responds to all of those kinds of events.

2063
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:43,330
中文字幕
And so let me actually go ahead and open up background.html

2064
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:45,070
中文字幕
and show how this is working.

2065
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:47,840
中文字幕
So for the most part, it's just HTML at first.

2066
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:52,010
中文字幕
Here's the html tag, the head tag, the body tag, and three new tags.

2067
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:53,680
中文字幕
This is another way of creating buttons.

2068
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,300
中文字幕
And again, this isn't interesting.

2069
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,340
中文字幕
You learn this in the online reference or manual.

2070
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,420
中文字幕
And it just tells you, here's how to use a button.

2071
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:02,410
中文字幕
It follows the same paradigm-- tag name, attribute equals value.

2072
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:04,930
中文字幕
The label is just going to be R, G, and B.

2073
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:08,560
中文字幕
And now this is where things get a little scary-looking at first.

2074
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,550
中文字幕
But that's it.

2075
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:13,520
中文字幕
There's just lines of code here inside of the web page.

2076
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,340
中文字幕
Now, let's walk through this line by line,

2077
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,860
中文字幕
even though it's a little verbose at first.

2078
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:20,560
中文字幕
So this first line here says, hey, browser,

2079
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,480
中文字幕
give me a variable called body.

2080
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,910
中文字幕
And store, in that variable, the node--

2081
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:27,130
中文字幕
the rectangle, so to speak--

2082
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,600
中文字幕
that has the name body.

2083
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,730
中文字幕
So that is, pluck that rectangle out of the picture

2084
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:32,270
中文字幕
so that I have direct access to it.

2085
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,880
中文字幕
Why-- because I'm going to manipulate it in just a moment.

2086
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,930
中文字幕
This is the scariest the JavaScript will look for now.

2087
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:41,500
中文字幕
Document.querySelector hash red-- could someone

2088
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:44,360
中文字幕
translate that into just English?

2089
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:47,540
中文字幕
What's that doing for me?

2090
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,960
中文字幕
Giving the ID of red that you just--

2091
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:50,840
中文字幕
Yeah.

2092
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,960
中文字幕
Be a little more verbose.

2093
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,400
中文字幕
Someone else?

2094
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:02,040
中文字幕
Hey, browser, select for me the node whose unique ID is red.

2095
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:02,730
中文字幕
That's fine.

2096
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:06,180
中文字幕
Give me access to that node, the structure in memory.

2097
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,410
中文字幕
And this is where it's a little weird.

2098
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:14,530
中文字幕
So it turns out that every tag in a web page or node in a tree--

2099
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:15,660
中文字幕
the DOM tree, so to speak--

2100
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:20,060
中文字幕
Document Object Model-- can have event listeners associated with it.

2101
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,230
中文字幕
And you would only know this from the documentation.

2102
01:35:22,230 --> 01:35:24,870
中文字幕
But if you literally say, go into this structure,

2103
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:28,440
中文字幕
this node, that represents the red button

2104
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:33,330
中文字幕
and get its on-click value, what's cool with JavaScript,

2105
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:35,460
中文字幕
even though the syntax is a little scary-looking,

2106
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:38,710
中文字幕
is you can associate a function with that event.

2107
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:42,870
中文字幕
So this is saying, hey, browser, when the red button is clicked on,

2108
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,060
中文字幕
call the following function.

2109
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:48,630
中文字幕
And what's new in JavaScript here is that this function, at the moment,

2110
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:50,580
中文字幕
has no name, which is weird.

2111
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:53,910
中文字幕
You could technically do this in C. But we always gave our functions names.

2112
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:56,040
中文字幕
But you don't really need to give a function a name

2113
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,100
中文字幕
if you don't need to mention it ever again.

2114
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,700
中文字幕
And the detail that's happening here for us is this.

2115
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:05,340
中文字幕
This says, hey, browser, on click, call this function.

2116
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,760
中文字幕
What does that mean in real terms?

2117
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,120
中文字幕
Hey, browser, call all of the lines of code

2118
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:12,320
中文字幕
in between this open curly brace and this close curly brace.

2119
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,160
中文字幕
So even if you're not comfy with the syntax,

2120
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,830
中文字幕
it just literally means execute the following lines of code

2121
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:18,880
中文字幕
when this button is clicked.

2122
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,290
中文字幕
This is what's known as an anonymous function insofar as it has no name.

2123
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:24,570
中文字幕
It's just function, open paren, close paren.

2124
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:28,050
中文字幕
So you can probably infer what it's doing on this line here.

2125
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:30,270
中文字幕
Let me highlight this line in blue.

2126
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:31,200
中文字幕
It's a little cryptic.

2127
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,800
中文字幕
And again, I promise that you're going to see lots of these dots.

2128
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,550
中文字幕
But this is saying, hey, browser, modify the body,

2129
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:42,060
中文字幕
or specifically, the style of the body, and specifically,

2130
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:48,210
中文字幕
the background color of the style of the body, to be, of course, red.

2131
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:52,980
中文字幕
And the rest of the code is copy-paste for now for green and blue as well.

2132
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:53,970
中文字幕
So what is happening?

2133
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:55,890
中文字幕
Every time you click on one of those buttons--

2134
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,990
中文字幕
R or G or B--

2135
01:36:57,990 --> 01:37:02,490
中文字幕
literally, this line of code is getting executed that I've just highlighted

2136
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:05,880
中文字幕
or this line of code is getting executed or this line of code

2137
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:06,990
中文字幕
is getting executed.

2138
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:09,240
中文字幕
So even though the syntax is, yes, admittedly, way

2139
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:13,170
中文字幕
more complicated than we've seen thus far, the idea is relatively simple.

2140
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:14,490
中文字幕
Select the button.

2141
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:17,350
中文字幕
Tell it, on clicking, to call this function.

2142
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:19,650
中文字幕
And it's fine early on if you just copy and paste this.

2143
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:22,660
中文字幕
And for Pset5, you won't have to use any of this code.

2144
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:25,440
中文字幕
This is in-- preemptive look at what you can

2145
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:31,560
中文字幕
do with an eye toward fancier features, like final projects and beyond.

2146
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,450
中文字幕
Any questions then on this background example?

2147
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:34,950
中文字幕
Yeah?

2148
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:40,240
中文字幕
Why did we use the pound symbol for red, green, blue, and not

2149
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:41,010
中文字幕
for body?

2150
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:41,430
中文字幕
Good question.

2151
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:44,830
中文字幕
Why do we use the pound symbol for red, green, and blue, but not for body?

2152
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:47,400
中文字幕
If you look at the HTML, you'll see the following.

2153
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,380
中文字幕
Body is, apparently, the name of a tag.

2154
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:53,550
中文字幕
So that's why we just selected "body" with that line of code around here.

2155
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:56,430
中文字幕
However, red, green, and blue are not the names of tags.

2156
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:59,400
中文字幕
They are the unique identifiers, values that I just came up with.

2157
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,700
中文字幕
I could have called it x, y, z.

2158
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,370
中文字幕
But I chose more descriptive terms.

2159
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:04,320
中文字幕
So whenever you want to reference or select

2160
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,950
中文字幕
a node who-- that has an identifier, you use the hash instead.

2161
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:09,450
中文字幕
That's all.

2162
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:12,110
中文字幕
These are just human conventions that are non-obvious unless you

2163
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:14,310
中文字幕
were told what they all mean.

2164
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:16,740
中文字幕
Let's try one other example with JavaScript.

2165
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:19,620
中文字幕
It's not uncommon on news websites to have the ability

2166
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,860
中文字幕
to change the font size, which you can, actually,

2167
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:24,240
中文字幕
do on your Mac and PC sometimes using keyboard shortcuts.

2168
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,590
中文字幕
But sometimes, it's built into the web page itself.

2169
01:38:26,590 --> 01:38:30,020
中文字幕
Let me go into, for instance, size.html.

2170
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:32,940
中文字幕
And here's some Latin text or Latin-like text.

2171
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,910
中文字幕
And notice that it has a little select menu.

2172
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:37,410
中文字幕
Normally, when you have a select menu, you select something.

2173
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:38,460
中文字幕
And then you click Submit.

2174
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,870
中文字幕
And then the server deals with it.

2175
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,280
中文字幕
The information goes somewhere.

2176
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,610
中文字幕
But you don't need to do that.

2177
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:46,380
中文字幕
You can actually make little menus interactive, just like text boxes.

2178
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,930
中文字幕
Suppose I want to make this text a little smaller.

2179
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:49,830
中文字幕
I can do that.

2180
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,630
中文字幕
I can choose extra small.

2181
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:55,950
中文字幕
I can do extra-extra small or I can do extra-extra large.

2182
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:57,490
中文字幕
And so what's going on here?

2183
01:38:57,490 --> 01:38:59,970
中文字幕
Well, just like there are click events in a browser,

2184
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:02,970
中文字幕
there are also change events or selection events.

2185
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:06,090
中文字幕
Just anything that can happen on the web page you can listen for.

2186
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:08,940
中文字幕
So let's take a look at this code, for instance.

2187
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,480
中文字幕
We've not seen this tag before.

2188
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,610
中文字幕
But we have seen paragraph.

2189
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:13,440
中文字幕
And there's a paragraph of Latin.

2190
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,120
中文字幕
And then there's a select tag, which gives you a select menu.

2191
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:18,720
中文字幕
A dropdown menu is called a select menu in HTML.

2192
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,650
中文字幕
And here's how you have all of the options.

2193
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:22,140
中文字幕
Now, there is a bit of duality here.

2194
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:26,160
中文字幕
There's what the human sees, which is between the open tag and close tag.

2195
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,430
中文字幕
And then there's this value, which the computer sees-- but more on that

2196
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,080
中文字幕
another time, when we get to Python.

2197
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,000
中文字幕
But this just gives me that whole menu of size options.

2198
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,380
中文字幕
And if I scroll down now, notice I have a script tag down here.

2199
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:41,400
中文字幕
And in this script tag, I have document.querySelector "select"

2200
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:45,510
中文字幕
because I want to select the name, the tag whose name is select.

2201
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:47,090
中文字幕
And then there's this event, onchange.

2202
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:49,090
中文字幕
And you'd only know this from the documentation.

2203
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,930
中文字幕
But like onsubmit, onchange is called any time you change that menu.

2204
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:53,550
中文字幕
What function should get called?

2205
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:56,060
中文字幕
Well, this one here, which is an anonymous in the sense

2206
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:57,440
中文字幕
that it has no name.

2207
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,130
中文字幕
And go ahead and do this.

2208
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:01,940
中文字幕
Select from the document the body tag.

2209
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:03,650
中文字幕
Get access to its style.

2210
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:09,110
中文字幕
And change its font size to, and this is funky here, this.value.

2211
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:11,960
中文字幕
So what did I do here?

2212
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:19,130
中文字幕
Let me do this, no pun intended.

2213
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:24,170
中文字幕
This refers to whatever element in the web page

2214
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:28,340
中文字幕
induced this function to be called.

2215
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:31,280
中文字幕
So this is-- you can think of as a variable, a special variable, that

2216
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:34,700
中文字幕
always refers to whatever element you are listening to.

2217
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:37,880
中文字幕
And so this.value just saves me some keystrokes because I don't-- you need

2218
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:42,920
中文字幕
to use document.querySelector to get at this select menu.

2219
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,290
中文字幕
But we'll see this again, perhaps, down the road.

2220
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:48,730
中文字幕
Questions?

2221
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:51,160
中文字幕
And let me point out one thing that's stupid.

2222
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:54,470
中文字幕
This here, fontSize, looks different from CSS.

2223
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:55,720
中文字幕
In CSS, what did we call this?

2224
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:01,800
中文字幕
Do you remember?

2225
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:05,250
中文字幕
We did font size small, medium, large.

2226
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:08,100
中文字幕
It was font-size.

2227
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,150
中文字幕
So this was left hand not talking to right hand

2228
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:11,490
中文字幕
when these things were invented.

2229
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:16,260
中文字幕
It turns out that dash is JavaScript means what, maybe?

2230
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,730
中文字幕
Minus or subtraction.

2231
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:20,910
中文字幕
And so this syntax just breaks in the context of JavaScript.

2232
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:21,930
中文字幕
So what did humans do?

2233
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:25,200
中文字幕
They decided that any time you have a CSS property that's word,

2234
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,420
中文字幕
dash, something, get rid of the dash.

2235
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,010
中文字幕
Capitalize the next word.

2236
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:31,890
中文字幕
And that's now the mapping in JavaScript-- so just a simple heuristic

2237
01:41:31,890 --> 01:41:34,540
中文字幕
there that you can perhaps keep in mind.

2238
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:38,230
中文字幕
Let's take a look, perhaps, at one final value--

2239
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:40,860
中文字幕
oh, how about two final values?

2240
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:44,280
中文字幕
Let's go ahead and do this with blink.html.

2241
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,880
中文字幕
So back in the day, when the web was first being invented

2242
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:51,180
中文字幕
and HTML was in its infancy, there was a wonderful tag

2243
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:53,190
中文字幕
that was probably on my own personal home page

2244
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:55,650
中文字幕
called blink that literally did that.

2245
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:59,400
中文字幕
You could have a tag that was open bracket, B-L-I-N-K, close bracket,

2246
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:03,240
中文字幕
put some words, then close the tag, and then your web page would just do this

2247
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,700
中文字幕
to all visitors, which humans eventually realized, well,

2248
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:10,370
中文字幕
this is dumb and really annoying to look at-- bad user experience, or UX.

2249
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:11,580
中文字幕
And so they took it away.

2250
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:14,670
中文字幕
It's one of the few tags, I think, from HTML that was actually removed

2251
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:16,310
中文字幕
by committee, as opposed to added.

2252
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:20,130
中文字幕
There was also marquee at the time, too, that-- like a theater sign would just

2253
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:22,650
中文字幕
scroll words across your page.

2254
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:26,110
中文字幕
So you've probably seen websites like this that recreate them in some way.

2255
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:27,960
中文字幕
But you can do this with JavaScript.

2256
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:31,050
中文字幕
Think about this logically.

2257
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:33,600
中文字幕
We know how, in code, we can change the style of an element.

2258
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,020
中文字幕
We've not seen how to do this yet.

2259
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:39,300
中文字幕
But you can make an element show or hide, show or hide.

2260
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:41,610
中文字幕
Turns out in JavaScript, you can use a timer.

2261
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,730
中文字幕
You have access to a clock.

2262
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:45,190
中文字幕
And you could actually write code that says, you know what?

2263
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:46,800
中文字幕
Every half-second, call this function.

2264
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,350
中文字幕
Call this function.

2265
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:53,100
中文字幕
And what that function does is it changes the style of the page

2266
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:56,190
中文字幕
to hide or show, hide or show.

2267
01:42:56,190 --> 01:42:57,900
中文字幕
Now, this used to be built into browsers.

2268
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,210
中文字幕
But now you can recreate it with something like that.

2269
01:43:00,210 --> 01:43:02,230
中文字幕
And I'll wave my hand at what the code is.

2270
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:04,110
中文字幕
But that's just one feature there.

2271
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:08,070
中文字幕
Let's look at one final example, though, that's a little creepy.

2272
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:10,090
中文字幕
Here's the code first.

2273
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:12,030
中文字幕
And this is called geolocation.

2274
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:15,240
中文字幕
This is all the rage now with apps like Uber and Waze

2275
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:18,240
中文字幕
and Find My Friends on iPhone and the like.

2276
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,850
中文字幕
Here is relatively little code that will figure out

2277
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:22,700
中文字幕
where your user is in the world.

2278
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:24,160
中文字幕
Now, it's a bit of a mouthful here.

2279
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:28,110
中文字幕
But it's mostly this file, html with a script tag.

2280
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:30,370
中文字幕
But there's this other special global variable.

2281
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,500
中文字幕
And we won't use this much.

2282
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:34,050
中文字幕
And indeed, you might not ever use it if you don't care about this feature.

2283
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:36,660
中文字幕
But it's called navigator, for historical reasons.

2284
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:39,060
中文字幕
And navigator has a feature called geolocation.

2285
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:42,210
中文字幕
And geolocation, which stands for locate people geographically,

2286
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:45,050
中文字幕
has a function called getCurrentPosition.

2287
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:46,760
中文字幕
And for reasons we won't really get into,

2288
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,180
中文字幕
it takes a function as an argument.

2289
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,920
中文字幕
This is a very common JavaScript paradigm,

2290
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,290
中文字幕
but more on this toward final projects, perhaps.

2291
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:56,220
中文字幕
This line of code is going to write to the document the user's

2292
01:43:56,220 --> 01:44:00,000
中文字幕
latitude and, if we scroll to the right, their longitude.

2293
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,680
中文字幕
So this is where it gets creepy.

2294
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:06,180
中文字幕
So if you were to use this code in your websites and a user were to visit,

2295
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:09,980
中文字幕
like I will now, and they click the link, they will be prompted,

2296
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:12,060
中文字幕
do you want the website to know your location?

2297
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:13,320
中文字幕
Sometimes, you might say yes.

2298
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:14,310
中文字幕
Sometimes, you might say no.

2299
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:16,470
中文字幕
Frankly, most of us probably just click Allow instinctively

2300
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:17,920
中文字幕
without really thinking about this.

2301
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,460
中文字幕
But there's where I am, apparently.

2302
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,290
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and highlight that.

2303
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:26,250
中文字幕
Let me go to maps.google.com because whatever website you just visited,

2304
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:28,370
中文字幕
whether it's Facebook or CNN or--

2305
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:30,460
中文字幕
a lot of news websites want to know where you are.

2306
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:33,420
中文字幕
If you go to like, what, fandango.com or the like for movie tickets,

2307
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:35,010
中文字幕
they might want to know where you are.

2308
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:37,140
中文字幕
Well, you're giving them very precise information.

2309
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:40,710
中文字幕
If I go ahead and search for these GPS coordinates on Google,

2310
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:43,960
中文字幕
that's not where I am.

2311
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,120
中文字幕
What the hell?

2312
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:50,160
中文字幕
Why are we in Oklahoma?

2313
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:03,200
中文字幕
I don't understand what's going on.

2314
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:04,830
中文字幕
This was not part of the demonstration.

2315
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:06,320
中文字幕
This was going to be the big climax.

2316
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,170
中文字幕
Let's turn off the wired internet in here.

2317
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:11,550
中文字幕
And apparently, we're going through Oklahoma today.

2318
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:14,190
中文字幕
Let's turn on the Wi-Fi, which will just give me

2319
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:16,830
中文字幕
a different IP address, which is a wonderful way to tie

2320
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:18,540
中文字幕
the start of the lecture together.

2321
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:21,150
中文字幕
If I wait a second, it should go green.

2322
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:22,510
中文字幕
Come on-- no IP address.

2323
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:24,460
中文字幕
Now these words might make a little more sense.

2324
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:25,140
中文字幕
Come on.

2325
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:26,550
中文字幕
Give me an IP address.

2326
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:28,800
中文字幕
Come on.

2327
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,270
中文字幕
Harvard-- there we go.

2328
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:31,630
中文字幕
There's my IP address.

2329
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:32,230
中文字幕
Let's reload.

2330
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:43,020
中文字幕
We'll email the IT people about this later.

2331
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:45,210
中文字幕
But all of my internet--

2332
01:45:45,210 --> 01:45:47,300
中文字幕
what this means is my--

2333
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:49,010
中文字幕
no, this is really weird.

2334
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,220
中文字幕
We have a lot of footage to cut out of today's video.

2335
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:56,100
中文字幕
So what this does is, with low probability,

2336
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,220
中文字幕
tell you where your users are in terms of latitude and longitude

2337
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:02,610
中文字幕
so that you could geolocate them, figure out what the local movie theaters are

2338
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:04,170
中文字幕
or what the starting times of stores are,

2339
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:06,040
中文字幕
give them directions to places, and the like.

2340
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,880
中文字幕
And while that was supposed to be the big climactic finish,

2341
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,320
中文字幕
apparently, none of this works.

2342
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,550
中文字幕
Today was completely wrong.

2343
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:12,390
中文字幕
We're in Oklahoma.

2344
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:13,440
中文字幕
But let's end here today.

2345
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:14,770
中文字幕
I'll stick around for questions.

2346
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:16,610
中文字幕
We'll see you next time.
