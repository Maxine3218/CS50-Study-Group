1
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,220
中文字幕
All right, this is CS50, and this is, sadly, the end,

2
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,550
中文字幕
where we wrap up the semester and take a look back at the past several weeks,

3
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,960
中文字幕
give you a look at what's ahead in the next several weeks,

4
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,800
中文字幕
and then really the next several years, how you can sort of go on,

5
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,150
中文字幕
beyond CS50, with the proverbial training wheels now completely off.

6
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,840
中文字幕
And so that even without things like CS50 IDE, and Check 50,

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,070
中文字幕
and Help 50, and other such tools, you actually

8
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,240
中文字幕
feel like you can apply all of these lessons learned, and all of these tools

9
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,770
中文字幕
you've experienced in CS50 to your own Macs and PCs in the real world.

10
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,830
中文字幕
But I thought it would be perhaps helpful or reassuring, especially

11
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,370
中文字幕
on the heels of so many problems sets, some of them especially challenging,

12
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,910
中文字幕
and a recent quiz here on campus, to just think back at this tenant here.

13
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,870
中文字幕
And we do mean this.

14
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,890
中文字幕
And realize if you're a little uneasy as to what

15
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,770
中文字幕
remains in store for the next few weeks, that

16
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,970
中文字幕
what ultimately matters in this course is not so much

17
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,890
中文字幕
where you end up relative to your classmates,

18
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,170
中文字幕
but where you end up in week 10, which is today, relative to yourself

19
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,610
中文字幕
in week zero, some 10 weeks ago.

20
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,930
中文字幕
So that was just a bold claim, a pie in the sky back then.

21
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,110
中文字幕
But you've made it to this now finish line, where all that remains

22
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,810
中文字幕
is that one final milestone, where there's no specification.

23
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,160
中文字幕
You're not told what to do, but you get to design and implement yourself.

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,620
中文字幕
And consider too, over the past several weeks,

25
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,400
中文字幕
odds are many of you never really felt like you got your footing, like ever.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,610
中文字幕
Just as you started to grasp something, we sort of pulled the rug out

27
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,390
中文字幕
from under you, or kind of asked you to take another step up cognitively,

28
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,100
中文字幕
and actually understand something new.

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,850
中文字幕
Well, that's very much the design of this.

30
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,720
中文字幕
I was trying to think of metaphors yesterday.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,310
中文字幕
And if you're into like weight lifting or such, which I'm not,

32
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,110
中文字幕
I suppose the analog here might be you're

33
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,470
中文字幕
sort of doing your weight lifting and someone

34
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,170
中文字幕
keeps putting more and more weight on the thing as you get better and better.

35
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,990
中文字幕
And so you never actually necessarily feel

36
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,460
中文字幕
like you're making progress, because it never gets any easier.

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,620
中文字幕
But that's just because the weight on either end is,

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,490
中文字幕
so I'm told, is getting added to and added to.

39
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,040
中文字幕
And I do mean that more academically here too,

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,960
中文字幕
is that with every passing week, we start

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,560
中文字幕
to hope that you were reasonably comfortable with what was in the past,

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,140
中文字幕
so that we could lead you further along in that journey.

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,820
中文字幕
And perhaps most stark is the fact that 10 weeks ago, many of you

44
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,160
中文字幕
probably found this difficult, right?

45
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,480
中文字幕
It's probably not all that distant a memory how many minutes, or hours,

46
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,510
中文字幕
or a few days that it actually took just to get Mario, so to speak--

47
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,220
中文字幕
and Mario's not even in the picture--

48
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,530
中文字幕
to just ascend this kind of pyramid by using hashtags.

49
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,650
中文字幕
And honestly, just a week ago, did you all

50
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,980
中文字幕
build this, CS50 finance, which had a back end implemented

51
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,040
中文字幕
in Python, generating HTML and CSS dynamically,

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,260
中文字幕
that was talking to a front end, that itself

53
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,770
中文字幕
was built with client-side languages, like HTML, and CSS, and JavaScript,

54
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,910
中文字幕
talking meanwhile to an API, via HTTP, that brought in data from a third party

55
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,690
中文字幕
source.

56
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,260
中文字幕
Like, that's where you now are.

57
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,890
中文字幕
And so even if you don't feel 100% like you could build this from scratch,

58
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,090
中文字幕
and that's fine, indeed what many students do for their final project is

59
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,830
中文字幕
start with something like P Set 8, tear out all the finance specific stuff,

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,000
中文字幕
and then start to add their own thoughts, and ideas,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,630
中文字幕
and their own code, notice just what the Delta truly is.

62
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,670
中文字幕
And that's what we mean by that Delta between week zero and week 10.

63
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,430
中文字幕
I received, just this past week, actually, an email

64
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,100
中文字幕
from one of your classmates, who I thought

65
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,340
中文字幕
was wonderfully reflective on what their experience had been like.

66
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,030
中文字幕
And quite consistent with this idea of not quite ever getting their footing,

67
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,400
中文字幕
wrote this, "Besides learning the new material,

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,040
中文字幕
I felt that I started to be more comfortable with being

69
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,220
中文字幕
uncomfortable and being OK with working towards building a skill,

70
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,860
中文字幕
rather than getting the right answer."

71
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,770
中文字幕
This is the kind of quote that you kind of see

72
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,020
中文字幕
in like a Harvard brochure or whatnot, but it's like, it really is true,

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,220
中文字幕
this idea of being comfortable being uncomfortable is very much the case.

74
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,310
中文字幕
And honestly, you're never really going to get your footing in this world.

75
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,890
中文字幕
Because honestly, everything we just taught this past semester

76
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,840
中文字幕
is going to evolve, starting tomorrow, and in the years to come.

77
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,670
中文字幕
But hopefully, what we've done in the class,

78
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,930
中文字幕
by choosing certain languages, some of the most foundational, like C,

79
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,310
中文字幕
and SQL, and now Python, even as those languages evolve themselves,

80
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,220
中文字幕
or become less used, the principles of memory management,

81
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,610
中文字幕
and data structures, and tradeoffs, and abstraction, and encapsulation, all

82
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,690
中文字幕
of those principles, those aren't going away.

83
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,860
中文字幕
And that's the advantage, I think, of starting from the so-called ground up.

84
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,500
中文字幕
It wasn't that long ago we were talking about zeros and ones.

85
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,140
中文字幕
So you're not just software engineers, you're

86
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,660
中文字幕
computer scientists, or budding computer scientists,

87
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,370
中文字幕
because you have those mental models that

88
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,090
中文字幕
can then be applied to any new technologies or domains that

89
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,120
中文字幕
are down the road.

90
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
中文字幕
And if it's reassuring too, even I feel this way.

91
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,460
中文字幕
Like, I don't feel like I've mastered CS50 or all of the material therein.

92
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,300
中文字幕
I kind of feel like that graph that we drew,

93
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,130
中文字幕
that was that green curved line, where like,

94
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,410
中文字幕
fortunately, I'm always making some forward progress,

95
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,690
中文字幕
but I'm never actually reaching the peak of anything,

96
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,610
中文字幕
because there's always something new to learn.

97
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,540
中文字幕
And it's scary, too.

98
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,080
中文字幕
And, in fact, the most relevant instance of being

99
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,150
中文字幕
comfortable being uncomfortable, or maybe if in my case,

100
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,340
中文字幕
being uncomfortable being uncomfortable, was just a few years ago.

101
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,470
中文字幕
For many years, CS50 had used a language called PHP for the web programming

102
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,380
中文字幕
portion of the course.

103
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,280
中文字幕
And eventually, we as the staff, decided it's time to transition

104
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
中文字幕
to Python, which has a number of upsides.

105
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
中文字幕
Among them, the applicability in the real world.

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
中文字幕
It can be used more effectively for command line

107
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,730
中文字幕
programs, data science, data analytics, and it just felt like it was time.

108
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,100
中文字幕
The one to catch was I didn't know Python.

109
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,550
中文字幕
And so this sounded like a wonderful idea, sort of philosophically,

110
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,130
中文字幕
that summer, yes, we shall teach Python this fall.

111
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,050
中文字幕
Then October came around, and I realized,

112
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,010
中文字幕
oh, Python's coming up in a week or two, we should probably, we, meaning I,

113
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,690
中文字幕
should probably go learn Python.

114
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,910
中文字幕
And so that entire semester, was I learning,

115
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,100
中文字幕
and we're repaving the road as we went.

116
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,100
中文字幕
And I swear, if you look back at the videos from just a few years ago,

117
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,250
中文字幕
the Python lecture was like the longest lecture ever we have.

118
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,250
中文字幕
Because I was so damn determined to prove to everyone that I knew Python

119
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,500
中文字幕
by that point in the semester.

120
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,970
中文字幕
So perhaps overcompensating a little bit.

121
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,070
中文字幕
But this is just to reassure that none of us

122
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,410
中文字幕
even the smartest of your teaching fellows and CAs, whom

123
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,820
中文字幕
you interacted with this year, and myself, like none of us

124
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,000
中文字幕
ever stop learning or stop being a little uncomfortable with this stuff.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,280
中文字幕
So even if you feel like, wow, I didn't quite absorb everything this semester,

126
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,370
中文字幕
you weren't ever going to, because we never did either.

127
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,010
中文字幕
So take that to heart if you would.

128
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,570
中文字幕
Before we forge ahead-- oh, in fact, I thought I'd mentioned to,

129
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,810
中文字幕
don't aspire to build this, for instance, mirrored

130
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,090
中文字幕
backgrounds kind of went out of vogue a long, long, long time ago.

131
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,840
中文字幕
But this was the first example of me building something, or trying

132
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,990
中文字幕
to solve a problem, that I had no idea how to do.

133
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,450
中文字幕
CS50 at the time did not teach web programming.

134
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,410
中文字幕
CS51 at the time did not teach web programming,

135
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,550
中文字幕
did not teach Perl, or CSV files, or the kind of ingredients

136
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,280
中文字幕
I needed to build this, or even HTML or CSS for that--

137
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,550
中文字幕
actually, there was no CSS at that time, or even HTML.

138
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,680
中文字幕
And so for me, too, this was an example of being

139
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,070
中文字幕
comfortable being uncomfortable, just volunteering I will build the Frosh I

140
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,990
中文字幕
Am's website, and then turning to my roommate,

141
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,530
中文字幕
and saying, how am I going to build the Frosh I Am's website,

142
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,370
中文字幕
and just getting comfortable with that idea.

143
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,480
中文字幕
You'll figure it out.

144
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,050
中文字幕
And honestly, the key secret is to just surround yourself

145
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,390
中文字幕
by really smart, smarter people, who know way more than you,

146
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,800
中文字幕
who are more comfortable than you, so you can stand on their shoulders

147
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,150
中文字幕
and learn from them along the way.

148
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,990
中文字幕
And indeed, allow me to thank, before we forge ahead, just a few

149
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,040
中文字幕
of the folks that you've either seen or not seen,

150
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,950
中文字幕
especially those behind the scenes here today,

151
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,680
中文字幕
Mike, and Luke, and Jose, and Tom, who, with media services,

152
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,390
中文字幕
have helped us with all of this amazing stuff over the past year.

153
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,190
中文字幕
CS50's production team, Dan and Tara, and Ian, and Andrew, a couple of whom

154
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,940
中文字幕
are new this year.

155
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,520
中文字幕
And I know they were really thrown into the fire.

156
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,100
中文字幕
You see one of them too, Max, the guy who's creepily got a camera on his head

157
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,100
中文字幕
today here-- oh, OK, who doesn't at the moment--

158
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,430
中文字幕
on our production team as well, all helped capture this.

159
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,090
中文字幕
And you'll see too, even this world, of videos influenced by software,

160
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,780
中文字幕
this other camera here, that's just robotically been going back and forth,

161
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,920
中文字幕
left to right all semester, controlled essentially by a PS4 controller,

162
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,170
中文字幕
via software and via a Wi-Fi connection thereto.

163
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,640
中文字幕
So thank you to the team for making possible so many of the experiences you

164
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,400
中文字幕
all have had here online.

165
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,750
中文字幕
And of course, there's a whole bigger team

166
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,040
中文字幕
teaching the class, the CAs, and the TFs, our preceptors,

167
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,400
中文字幕
and the heads of the class, without whom I certainly could not do this.

168
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,780
中文字幕
These are all of their names there, sandwiched in.

169
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,580
中文字幕
And perhaps if we could, and we'll let them

170
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,930
中文字幕
know by playing the video for them, such a round

171
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,680
中文字幕
of applause that they got here at lecture is thanks for their time

172
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,440
中文字幕
with us this year.

173
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,090
中文字幕
If we could.

174
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,840
中文字幕
In particular, you might have noticed the notes

175
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,850
中文字幕
that are on the course's website, usually a couple of days

176
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,570
中文字幕
after the lecture.

177
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,360
中文字幕
And this is all thanks to a former teaching

178
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,030
中文字幕
fellow, Cheng Gong, who graduated a few years ago in computer science,

179
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,340
中文字幕
and has wonderfully continue to watch the course's videos, just

180
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,840
中文字幕
a few hours, typically, after they air, so as to provide you

181
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,380
中文字幕
with a canonical set of notes, so that you're not yourselves,

182
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,380
中文字幕
heads down, scribbling everything down.

183
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,720
中文字幕
Cheng, therefore, is going to be hearing and listening to these very words.

184
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,010
中文字幕
And therefore, I've been told to say just what a wonderful person Chang

185
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,000
中文字幕
Gong is, and how we couldn't do the course so well without him,

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,880
中文字幕
and we really forever appreciate all of his contributions to CS50,

187
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,780
中文字幕
and he would make a wonderful addition to any tech company out there.

188
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,730
中文字幕
So, thank you.

189
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,750
中文字幕
Thank you to Chang, as well.

190
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,650
中文字幕
And allow me to call out a couple of folks

191
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,820
中文字幕
in particular, two of our undergrads, who among the most involved

192
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,320
中文字幕
in the course, behind the scenes and in front of the scenes.

193
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,200
中文字幕
One of whom is in the process of translating the course into Spanish

194
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,040
中文字幕
with us, so that we can make it available not only to students here,

195
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,070
中文字幕
but also natively to folks elsewhere in the world for whom

196
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,460
中文字幕
English is a second, or not even, a third language.

197
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,800
中文字幕
And therefore, the English aspects of the class despite,

198
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,770
中文字幕
its being open courseware, are just an unnecessary hurdle,

199
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,110
中文字幕
in terms of the software, and the content, and so forth.

200
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,150
中文字幕
And so, in fact, I thought I'd give you a glimpse

201
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:26,160
中文字幕
of what CS50's own Veronica has been doing over the past few months.

202
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,310
中文字幕
For instance, this is what awaits students online soon,

203
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,840
中文字幕
as they, themselves, tackle, just as the Myla helped us here in English, Mario,

204
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,530
中文字幕
for instance.

205
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:53,730
中文字幕
VERONICA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

206
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,700
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: My thanks to other folks behind the scenes, some of whom

207
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,990
中文字幕
you might have met, Aaron, and Greg, and Doug, and then one other member

208
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,000
中文字幕
of the course's heads, who sadly, will be graduating this coming spring.

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,990
中文字幕
Brian Yu literally wandered into my office a few years ago.

210
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,040
中文字幕
And we got to chatting about whether he could get

211
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,990
中文字幕
involved in some form in the course.

212
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,290
中文字幕
And here now, three or so years later, he spent January's with us,

213
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,540
中文字幕
summers here with us, and pretty much runs the show now.

214
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,370
中文字幕
And honestly, of all of the head teaching fellows we've had, all of them

215
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,640
中文字幕
are amazing, but there really is something special about Brian Yu.

216
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,820
中文字幕
And honestly, in a word, he is extraordinary.

217
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,340
中文字幕
And what I thought we'd do is, as thanks to the staff,

218
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,820
中文字幕
and as an invitation to you all, to consider applying to join us as a TF,

219
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,450
中文字幕
as a CA, as a photographer, as a producer, any number of hats

220
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,110
中文字幕
that the team here wears, we filmed in advance, thanks to CS50's production

221
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,510
中文字幕
team, and thanks CS50's own Connor Doyle, and undergrad,

222
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,090
中文字幕
put together the following film that Brian has beautifully introduced us to.

223
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,720
中文字幕
And then we'll take a quick look back at some of our volunteers

224
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,530
中文字幕
who have appeared here in lectures past on stage, CS50 Puzzle Day

225
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,890
中文字幕
lunches, and more, as a bit of reflection on where you've all

226
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,460
中文字幕
come this past year.

227
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,940
中文字幕
If we could dim the lights again.

228
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,260
中文字幕
And off [INAUDIBLE]

229
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,590
中文字幕
(SINGING) Help me out, let me down.

230
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:35,070
中文字幕
I could learn from you, I could learn from you.

231
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,550
中文字幕
Help me out, let me down.

232
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:47,020
中文字幕
I could learn from you.

233
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,960
中文字幕
So if we could, a round of applause again for the staff.

234
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,130
中文字幕
So let's take a quick look back then at what

235
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,930
中文字幕
it meant to be 10 weeks ago, when we tore, and I was actually just thinking,

236
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,060
中文字幕
we probably should have added the meme clip to that part of the video here,

237
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,390
中文字幕
we tore this phone book in half and began our discussion

238
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,460
中文字幕
of computational thinking and all things thereafter.

239
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,710
中文字幕
And what we hope to do with this quick look,

240
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,320
中文字幕
is to just remind you just how far, truly, you've come,

241
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,080
中文字幕
and to sort of remind how hopefully a number of these topics

242
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,810
中文字幕
have all coincided and intermingled.

243
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,310
中文字幕
So this was computer science, right?

244
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,890
中文字幕
In week zero, we proposed this black box, that we revealed to be algorithms.

245
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,380
中文字幕
And we had inputs and outputs.

246
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,000
中文字幕
We needed to represent those inputs and outputs, and thus

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,690
中文字幕
were it was born zeros, and ones, and binary.

248
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,300
中文字幕
And from there, did we talk about higher level abstractions,

249
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,570
中文字幕
talking about how you might have decimal or letters of the alphabet, ASCII

250
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,320
中文字幕
and Unicode, the number 65, representing the same there,

251
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,170
中文字幕
the same pattern of bits might represents something like a dot,

252
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,350
中文字幕
or a pixel of yellow.

253
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,440
中文字幕
If you have a whole bunch of those dots or pixels,

254
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,360
中文字幕
you might have a crying face of joy.

255
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
中文字幕
And if you might have multiple images like that,

256
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,800
中文字幕
you might have animojis or videos, more generally,

257
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,530
中文字幕
which are just yet another abstraction on top of that.

258
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,160
中文字幕
And so, as you go out into the real world now, after CS50,

259
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,610
中文字幕
and see pretty fancy and newfangled technologies,

260
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,320
中文字幕
just start to critique them in your mind.

261
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,580
中文字幕
And consider, well, I know how this feature is done,

262
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,740
中文字幕
and I know how that feature implements that feature.

263
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,070
中文字幕
Odds are, you can reverse engineer in your mind how many

264
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,050
中文字幕
of today's technologies work, just by building

265
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,960
中文字幕
backwards to those lower levels.

266
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,800
中文字幕
We then introduced pseudo-codes, so we could

267
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,630
中文字幕
talk about what it meant to express yourself

268
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,050
中文字幕
more carefully, more methodically.

269
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,340
中文字幕
And we introduced loops, and conditions, and variables,

270
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,360
中文字幕
and other such tenants, that we then translated,

271
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,660
中文字幕
eventually to another language.

272
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,590
中文字幕
And we also talked not about correctness, but about efficiency.

273
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,920
中文字幕
So that you have a mental model of just how good your code, or your algorithm,

274
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
中文字幕
or your thought ultimately is.

275
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,760
中文字幕
And then was introduced Scratch, so that you

276
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,190
中文字幕
had a way, albeit graphically, to express

277
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,150
中文字幕
all of these various components, by programming Scratch up and down,

278
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,440
中文字幕
and left and right.

279
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,410
中文字幕
Of course, things got pretty scary, or ugly, pretty quickly.

280
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,710
中文字幕
We then transitioned to C, when all of a sudden, the simplest of "Hello world,"

281
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,030
中文字幕
started to look like that.

282
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,030
中文字幕
Odds are, that first week, if you'd never seen any programming

283
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,700
中文字幕
language before, let alone C, most of those lines

284
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,020
中文字幕
did not look familiar, except for perhaps the "Hello world,"

285
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,300
中文字幕
but even that thing was followed by some random backslash n.

286
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,110
中文字幕
And all of that have we, hopefully, teased apart over the past many weeks.

287
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,600
中文字幕
That, of course, gets compiled down to zeros and ones,

288
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
中文字幕
which the computer only understands.

289
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,010
中文字幕
And thankfully, we humans live in an age where

290
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,840
中文字幕
we don't need to worry about that level, or relatively few

291
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,910
中文字幕
of us do, because we have abstractions, and libraries,

292
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,580
中文字幕
and other developments on top.

293
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,140
中文字幕
In week two, did we then introduce other aspects of programming,

294
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,160
中文字幕
and functions, and return values, and the like.

295
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,000
中文字幕
And we also talked about what's really going on underneath the hood.

296
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,640
中文字幕
Code, like this here, for instance, gets compiled often

297
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,080
中文字幕
into multiple files, CS50s, standard iOS and your own code,

298
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,850
中文字幕
and then they all get linked together.

299
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,980
中文字幕
But there too, that's what you're getting for free,

300
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,730
中文字幕
so to speak, by running a compiler like Clang, albeit again

301
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,950
中文字幕
and again, whenever you make a change to your code.

302
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,200
中文字幕
We introduced the notion of memory, a little chip that

303
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,170
中文字幕
might be in your computer.

304
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,020
中文字幕
And if we zoom in on that, it really is just

305
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,190
中文字幕
this beautiful, simple canvas of bytes, top to bottom,

306
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,440
中文字幕
left to right, that you can do anything you want with.

307
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,190
中文字幕
Like that is it.

308
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,650
中文字幕
Despite all of the seeming complexity of a computer,

309
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,410
中文字幕
that is the canvas that you have to work with.

310
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,820
中文字幕
And that was allowing us to do any number of the data structures

311
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,040
中文字幕
and algorithms on top of it.

312
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,250
中文字幕
For instance, in week three, we talked about strings.

313
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,940
中文字幕
And strings were very straightforward.

314
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,820
中文字幕
You might not have heard the word initially

315
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,570
中文字幕
in the context of programming, but just a sequence of characters,

316
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,610
中文字幕
like a word, a phrase, a sentence, or such.

317
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,160
中文字幕
And then things got scary again quickly, when we said,

318
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,470
中文字幕
those are a little bit of a white lie, and abstraction,

319
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,260
中文字幕
more properly, on top of pointers.

320
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,290
中文字幕
Of course, pointers themselves got a little scary quickly.

321
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,370
中文字幕
And even in retrospect, this might still look scary.

322
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,040
中文字幕
And that's fine.

323
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,110
中文字幕
The reality most of you will not have occasion to program in C again.

324
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,640
中文字幕
The only occasions I have are generally in September and October of every year,

325
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,440
中文字幕
myself, because in the real world, I tend not to use this language,

326
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,750
中文字幕
though it does remain super popular and super commonly used,

327
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,290
中文字幕
especially in hardware based contexts, where you really

328
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,120
中文字幕
want to squeeze as much performance as possible out of the hardware,

329
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,080
中文字幕
and you don't necessarily want the overhead of a higher level language,

330
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,620
中文字幕
like Python.

331
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,750
中文字幕
But what's important is just those principles.

332
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,020
中文字幕
The fact that you can put things in memory, you can go there,

333
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,040
中文字幕
you can move them.

334
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,550
中文字幕
That's all this crazy syntax has been doing for us.

335
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,140
中文字幕
Of course, it didn't end well for Binky, when you abused this.

336
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,450
中文字幕
And indeed a lot of today's programming errors, even

337
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,680
中文字幕
ones that are still with us today, reduce to misusing or accidentally

338
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,090
中文字幕
touching memory that you should not.

339
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,860
中文字幕
But once you have that primitive, this ability to stitch things together

340
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,190
中文字幕
in memory, then you can start to build things in software.

341
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,240
中文字幕
We introduced Structs, in C, which allow us to come up with our own custom data

342
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,190
中文字幕
types that have multiple things inside of them.

343
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,110
中文字幕
And once you have that, if one of those things

344
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,270
中文字幕
is itself a pointer to something else, you

345
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,760
中文字幕
can kind of string things together in memory,

346
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,730
中文字幕
thereby giving you access to linked lists, which solve problems when

347
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,370
中文字幕
it comes to the limitations of arrays.

348
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,300
中文字幕
And you can do even fancier things like hash tables, that might conceptually

349
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,670
中文字幕
and pictorial look like this, or even the crazier

350
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,320
中文字幕
tri, which theoretically, is even more efficient,

351
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,450
中文字幕
it just takes up so much more space.

352
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,320
中文字幕
But that's it.

353
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,220
中文字幕
With pointers, all you're doing is stitching these data structures

354
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,720
中文字幕
together.

355
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,640
中文字幕
And even though most languages on top of C, like Python, and Java, and PHP,

356
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,130
中文字幕
and Ruby, don't have pointers per se, they

357
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,650
中文字幕
have the idea of addresses or references still.

358
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,080
中文字幕
So the concept is there, they've just made it a little easier

359
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,040
中文字幕
not to shoot yourself in the foot by making mistakes and getting things

360
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,680
中文字幕
like seg fault. The compilers and the interpreters

361
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,660
中文字幕
are increasingly getting good at helping you protect yourself from human error.

362
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,470
中文字幕
And then, thereafter, we began to transition, felt like a long time in C,

363
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,890
中文字幕
but we began to talk about HTTP, and virtual envelopes and messages,

364
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,990
中文字幕
just going from point A to point B. And among those things were headers.

365
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,010
中文字幕
And you'll recall, perhaps among the more amusing headers,

366
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,920
中文字幕
was this one, bought some years ago.

367
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,580
中文字幕
If you use a browser or if you use Curl, like a program at the command

368
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,180
中文字幕
line, and the IDE, or your Mac or PC, and you actually request this,

369
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,690
中文字幕
what was the status code that came back?

370
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,910
中文字幕
Anyone recall?

371
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,790
中文字幕
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

372
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,280
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: Wasn't 200, wasn't 404.

373
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
中文字幕
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

374
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,450
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, it was like permanently redirected.

375
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,730
中文字幕
I think 301 or 302 came back, and where did it lead to?

376
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,900
中文字幕
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

377
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,030
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: Yale University.

378
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,180
中文字幕
So that was nice and fun.

379
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,320
中文字幕
Of course, they bought HarvardSucks.org some time ago.

380
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,070
中文字幕
And for those unfamiliar, this weekend is,

381
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,380
中文字幕
of course, the Harvard-Yale football game, here in Cambridge this year.

382
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,880
中文字幕
So as clever as Yale has been for like a decade of paying annually

383
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,320
中文字幕
for, or rather as clever as we have been, whoever the alum,

384
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,560
中文字幕
is paying for a decade for Safetyschool.org

385
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,050
中文字幕
redirecting to Yale.edu, unfortunately, HarvardSucks.org also lives on.

386
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,220
中文字幕
In fact, there's a whole wonderful back story there,

387
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,700
中文字幕
that was about 12-plus years ago now.

388
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,290
中文字幕
Where some enterprising students at Yale kind of really got us.

389
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,580
中文字幕
Have folks seen or heard this story?

390
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,220
中文字幕
So we really embarrassed ourselves some years ago.

391
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,310
中文字幕
And it will all boil down to some very enterprising Yale students

392
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,010
中文字幕
using a little bit of software and a computer program

393
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,600
中文字幕
to create an actual bitmap, like a grid of pixels using humans.

394
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,440
中文字幕
The problem was that those humans were us, on the Harvard side,

395
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,970
中文字幕
in the Harvard stadium.

396
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,770
中文字幕
Because we essentially created a bitmap message, thanks to their cleverness.

397
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,320
中文字幕
So I thought we'd dim the lights and for about three minutes,

398
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,210
中文字幕
look at just how bad they got us.

399
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,690
中文字幕
Now to be fair, we got them for like 12 years, or 19 years of football

400
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,490
中文字幕
thereafter, though they have been winning the past couple of years.

401
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,620
中文字幕
So we can't really talk about this now.

402
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:30,760
中文字幕
So without further ado, let's dim the lights and pull this look up too.

403
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,750
中文字幕
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

404
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:39,480
中文字幕
- We're headed up to Boston, checking out the stadium for a prank.

405
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,220
中文字幕
- A few years ago, I was at a math conference.

406
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,410
中文字幕
And I was sitting around at the table at dinner,

407
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,990
中文字幕
with a few other mathematicians.

408
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,530
中文字幕
And one of them went to Harvard, and started

409
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,690
中文字幕
telling the story of this amazing prank that was against Harvard.

410
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,030
中文字幕
And at that point, I felt I had to interrupt,

411
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,360
中文字幕
and said, well, actually I can tell you a lot more about that.

412
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,460
中文字幕
- OK.

413
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,710
中文字幕
- The idea was perfected in a dorm room.

414
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,140
中文字幕
- We came up with the idea, actually, to prank them

415
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,950
中文字幕
with signs at the football game.

416
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,480
中文字幕
We threw some ideas out there as far as what the signs would say.

417
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,150
中文字幕
We eventually settled on "We Suck."

418
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,240
中文字幕
and my immediate reaction was, no, this will never work.

419
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,380
中文字幕
However, the problem solver in me started thinking, well, maybe we

420
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,870
中文字幕
can make this work.

421
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,640
中文字幕
- The problem, they had to infiltrate Harvard stadium without getting caught,

422
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,310
中文字幕
sneak in 1,800 placards, distribute them to unsuspecting Harvard fans,

423
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,820
中文字幕
and then convince those fans to prank themselves.

424
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,690
中文字幕
- That's great.

425
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,520
中文字幕
- We thought about basically every possible thing that could go wrong

426
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,640
中文字幕
and tried to come up with a solution for it.

427
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,380
中文字幕
- And then you put two guys on top of it.

428
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,270
中文字幕
- They made fake Harvard IDs and fake backstories, fake placard designs,

429
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,240
中文字幕
and a 28-member fake pep squad.

430
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,430
中文字幕
On November 20th, 2004, the fake Harvard students

431
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,210
中文字幕
smuggled the placards into the game.

432
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,650
中文字幕
- What do you think of Yale, sir?

433
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,610
中文字幕
- They suck.

434
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,810
中文字幕
- It's not going to say something like Yale sucks, is it?

435
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,390
中文字幕
- It says go Harvard.

436
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,560
中文字幕
- But then, trouble.

437
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,240
中文字幕
- What houses are you guys in?

438
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,190
中文字幕
- That's not a real house.

439
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,690
中文字幕
- Ho-fo?

440
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,660
中文字幕
- Yeah.

441
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,460
中文字幕
- You guys aren't from Harvard, are you?

442
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,550
中文字幕
- Can I see your Harvard ID because I really think you guys are from Yale.

443
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,740
中文字幕
- I just showed him the front of this ID,

444
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,940
中文字幕
and all the sudden, he just ran away, and he felt so embarrassed.

445
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,020
中文字幕
- Having escaped one confrontation, they couldn't risk another.

446
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,050
中文字幕
It was time.

447
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,390
中文字幕
- This just looks like a total mess.

448
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,870
中文字幕
- We have absolutely no idea if this is going to work.

449
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,370
中文字幕
- Look at them, they have the paper.

450
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,610
中文字幕
It's actually going to happen.

451
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,810
中文字幕
I can't [BEEP] believe this.

452
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:04,080
中文字幕
- What was once a prank, became a legend.

453
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,580
中文字幕
- We did it.

454
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,480
中文字幕
- And immediately, we started hearing chants from the other side.

455
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,500
中文字幕
You suck.

456
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,250
中文字幕
- You suck, you suck, you suck.

457
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,320
中文字幕
- And I think it was at that point in time that we knew we had pulled it off.

458
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,850
中文字幕
- One more time.

459
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,770
中文字幕
- There it goes again.

460
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,540
中文字幕
- I really think it didn't matter that Harvard

461
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,690
中文字幕
won, because of the prank for a lot of Yale students and alumni,

462
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,860
中文字幕
we definitely won that year.

463
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,750
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: So there you go problem solving at Harvard, Yale as well.

464
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,140
中文字幕
All right, the bar has been set.

465
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,260
中文字幕
So thereafter, let's try to somehow make this more academic

466
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,960
中文字幕
again, so thereafter, did we transition from looking at the principles of HTTP,

467
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,090
中文字幕
and the envelopes with which you can send messages,

468
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,470
中文字幕
and actually introduced a language with which

469
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,200
中文字幕
we can create user interfaces and things far more interesting

470
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,570
中文字幕
than terminal windows alone.

471
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,070
中文字幕
Of course, there was a connection even to the material past,

472
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,110
中文字幕
because underneath the hood, what your browser is

473
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,630
中文字幕
doing is reading that HTML, top to bottom, left to right,

474
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,730
中文字幕
and building really a tree structure in memory,

475
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,210
中文字幕
that you can then manipulate using JavaScript, yet another language.

476
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,810
中文字幕
And then in week six, did we tragically point out

477
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,690
中文字幕
that all that complexity we'd wrestled with just a few weeks ago,

478
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,320
中文字幕
trying to build a linked list with null at the end and pointers throughout,

479
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,010
中文字幕
actually reduces to just this in Python, just a single line of code.

480
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,410
中文字幕
And then this amazing data structure that theoretically

481
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,390
中文字幕
has constant time access and dynamic growth,

482
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,190
中文字幕
because you can chain everything off of it.

483
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,490
中文字幕
You just have to write a lot of code to do all the memory management,

484
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,200
中文字幕
is just this in Python.

485
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,970
中文字幕
But underneath the hood, that is what Python is doing.

486
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,350
中文字幕
In fact, a lot of the Python interpreter, the program called Python,

487
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,100
中文字幕
is itself written in C. And so someone, just thankfully not you,

488
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,140
中文字幕
has had to write all of that functionality.

489
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,030
中文字幕
But Python itself is just an abstraction.

490
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,630
中文字幕
These functions are abstractions on top of these lower level implementation

491
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,320
中文字幕
details.

492
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,850
中文字幕
And that should really become part of your vocabulary,

493
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,900
中文字幕
distinguishing between design, and abstractions, and lower level

494
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,370
中文字幕
implementation details, all of which are important,

495
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,570
中文字幕
but they don't all need to be at the tip of your mind

496
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,660
中文字幕
when you're thinking about how to solve a problem.

497
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,220
中文字幕
You can solve problems at this level.

498
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,970
中文字幕
And then lower down into the implementation details.

499
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,100
中文字幕
So after that, we tried to tie everything together.

500
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
中文字幕
And we looked more generally at web programming.

501
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,340
中文字幕
We just looked at one paradigm of web programming, the MVC model,

502
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,910
中文字幕
so to speak.

503
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,400
中文字幕
There are dozens, probably more these days,

504
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,470
中文字幕
all of them with fancy confusing acronyms.

505
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,660
中文字幕
But it's just different ways to solve problem.

506
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,670
中文字幕
Because we humans, with each passing year,

507
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,640
中文字幕
realize that, hey, I, in my company, and you, in your company,

508
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,400
中文字幕
and you, in your dorm, we're all trying to solve similar ideas.

509
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,510
中文字幕
We're all trying to make an app.

510
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,960
中文字幕
We're all trying to make a website.

511
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,540
中文字幕
And we're all reinventing wheels.

512
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,540
中文字幕
And so new frameworks are invented, and new methodologies, and people

513
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,470
中文字幕
start sharing.

514
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,860
中文字幕
And the world starts to collaborate by way of open source tools,

515
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,340
中文字幕
that we, ourselves, have used, like Flask being one such example thereof,

516
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,220
中文字幕
jQuery a little bit, Bootstrap as well, all of which

517
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,440
中文字幕
allow us to sort of solve problems collectively

518
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,770
中文字幕
and get real, more interesting work done without having to deal with all

519
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,960
中文字幕
of those implementation details.

520
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,740
中文字幕
And then lastly, did we introduce one last language, SQL,

521
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,700
中文字幕
which gave us all the more of a back end, where

522
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,980
中文字幕
we can store stuff, a lot more stuff, and a lot

523
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,380
中文字幕
more easily than we could with CSVs alone.

524
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,960
中文字幕
And if you like this world of statistics, and data science,

525
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,840
中文字幕
and the like, or if you're going back to the world of the humanities,

526
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,090
中文字幕
or medicine, or any number of fields, where there's just lots of words,

527
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,740
中文字幕
lots of books, lots of texts, lots of data, ultimately, SQL,

528
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,100
中文字幕
and all of these languages can be used to help you answer questions

529
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,540
中文字幕
that you might have in those domains.

530
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,450
中文字幕
So from there, where do we go?

531
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,530
中文字幕
So after Thanksgiving break here in Cambridge is the CS50 hackathon.

532
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,750
中文字幕
It will begin at 7:00 PM in the evening, and it will end at 7:00 AM

533
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,560
中文字幕
the next night.

534
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,650
中文字幕
And it's meant to be one of those uniquely collegiate experiences, where

535
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,650
中文字幕
you have alongside you all of your friends and classmates,

536
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,340
中文字幕
and all of the course's staff into the night, working on final projects.

537
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,810
中文字幕
An opportunity to be productive.

538
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,020
中文字幕
An opportunity far enough away from the deadline to feel good about it

539
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,680
中文字幕
and to take breaks, and to have dinner with us at 9:00 PM,

540
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,780
中文字幕
to have second dinner with us around 1:00 AM.

541
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,580
中文字幕
And then if you're still awake, around 5:00

542
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,340
中文字幕
AM we charter some Harvard shuttles, and take ourselves

543
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,100
中文字幕
to IHOP for breakfast as well.

544
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,530
中文字幕
But you're welcome to go to sleep at any point in between.

545
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,320
中文字幕
Just to give you a sense of what it's like.

546
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,760
中文字幕
On arrival, the students from both Harvard and Yale

547
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,270
中文字幕
ascend the stairs, joining the staff for the evening of programming.

548
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,750
中文字幕
We have reserved the entire space above the Innovation Lab

549
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,770
中文字幕
across the river at HBS, where everyone will

550
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,610
中文字幕
be able to tuck themselves away into a corner with their partners,

551
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,320
中文字幕
or with their friends, or classmates more

552
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,260
中文字幕
generally, and just work throughout the night on their final projects.

553
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,660
中文字幕
There's a photo booth, and a Myla as well,

554
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,460
中文字幕
as well as other members of the staff.

555
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,700
中文字幕
There are therapy dogs in some years, if you'd like to take a little break

556
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,430
中文字幕
and meet such puppies as these.

557
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,410
中文字幕
And then, of course, at 5:00 AM, is IHOP.

558
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,840
中文字幕
And this is Maria Zlatkova, now at Facebook,

559
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,150
中文字幕
greeting us at last year's breakfast.

560
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,440
中文字幕
And then the CS50 fair.

561
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,910
中文字幕
On both campuses is this event.

562
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,740
中文字幕
An opportunity for all of you to show off

563
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,010
中文字幕
just what you accomplish this semester, truly meant

564
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,010
中文字幕
to be the capstone of what you've done, not exhibiting your own problems

565
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,470
中文字幕
sets that you were told how to build, but your own project that you yourself

566
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,510
中文字幕
decided how to.

567
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,150
中文字幕
We'll invite the entire campus, the faculty, students, and staff

568
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,080
中文字幕
from across campus.

569
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,000
中文字幕
Usually it's about 2,000-plus people.

570
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,550
中文字幕
We'll be in the beautifully renovated Smith Center this year,

571
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,610
中文字幕
right in Harvard Square.

572
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,110
中文字幕
So we expect to have quite a few passers by and tourists as well.

573
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,410
中文字幕
It's always coupled with a fabulous raffle, whereby

574
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,080
中文字幕
you'll all be given, as student presenters, little smiley face

575
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,870
中文字幕
stickers or such.

576
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,380
中文字幕
Anyone who chats you up and asks you about your project

577
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,380
中文字幕
and for a quick demo on your laptop or phone,

578
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,090
中文字幕
you'll be able to hand them a sticker and be eligible, therefore,

579
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,140
中文字幕
for fabulous prizes.

580
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,630
中文字幕
Along the way though, there'll be popcorn, and snacks,

581
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,630
中文字幕
and music, and more.

582
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,590
中文字幕
Some of our alumni from industry to talk to you

583
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,010
中文字幕
about the real world, and summer time, and full-time opportunities as well.

584
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,250
中文字幕
And what you'll see is a space that looks, and feels, and sounds,

585
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,620
中文字幕
rather like this, with folks just mingling around,

586
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,970
中文字幕
really proud and happy to see what it is that you and your friends pulled off.

587
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,570
中文字幕
With popcorn in attendance, stress balls in attendance, and staff, and students

588
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,810
中文字幕
alike, hopefully delighting in what it is that you did.

589
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,780
中文字幕
Everyone will end the semester with a I took CS50 t-shirt.

590
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,990
中文字幕
Hopefully, this is something you two will wear proud.

591
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,340
中文字幕
In fact, this truly is where I got my start.

592
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,730
中文字幕
1996, CS50 changed my life.

593
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,650
中文字幕
And, in fact-- in fact, here, is indeed proof

594
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,920
中文字幕
of just how proud I am to have actually gotten my way through this course

595
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,350
中文字幕
so long ago, when I, myself, had not had the nerve freshman year even to shop.

596
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,010
中文字幕
So hopefully, you feel yourselves a member of that community as well.

597
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,270
中文字幕
So of course, we thought we'd give you a sense of what the next few weeks might

598
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,810
中文字幕
be like, especially if you don't necessarily budget your time properly.

599
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,000
中文字幕
A few years ago, we used before the CS50 IDE,

600
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,430
中文字幕
the software called CS59 Appliance, which

601
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,850
中文字幕
was like a downloadable version of it for your Mac and PC.

602
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,680
中文字幕
It tended to be a little slower, and you'll see an allusion to that.

603
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,710
中文字幕
But this video produced by CS50's production team, and particularly

604
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,980
中文字幕
Dan Coffee, was CS50's first experimentation with puppetry.

605
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,110
中文字幕
And you'll see that we tell the story by proxy

606
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,660
中文字幕
of a CS50 student working on their final project, just as the deadline nears.

607
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,500
中文字幕
And so if we could dim the lights, this will

608
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,840
中文字幕
be our last of the videos for today before we now look ahead at the years

609
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,280
中文字幕
after.

610
00:31:21,760 --> 00:33:56,080
中文字幕
- "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE"]

611
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,060
中文字幕
So our thanks to Dan Coffee and the team for producing that

612
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,550
中文字幕
as well, if we could.

613
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,810
中文字幕
That is indeed exactly how deadlines work.

614
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,880
中文字幕
Every time we have a deadline, I--

615
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,130
中文字幕
So life after 50.

616
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,060
中文字幕
So the training wheels are off, you can keep the rubber duck

617
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,550
中文字幕
and have someone to talk to as you wrestle with problems.

618
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,770
中文字幕
But the CS50 IDE, while you can keep using it,

619
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,070
中文字幕
it's not something you, odds are, going to use in the real world for very long.

620
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,380
中文字幕
And there really is no check 50 and help 50 in the real world,

621
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,710
中文字幕
though there are lots of humans.

622
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,670
中文字幕
They are not called TFs anymore, they're called friends and colleagues.

623
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,100
中文字幕
But you can lean on those folks as well.

624
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,290
中文字幕
And what we thought we'd give you is some list

625
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,340
中文字幕
of suggestions for next steps, so that you feel like there's offboarding.

626
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,870
中文字幕
And honestly, some of this will happen naturally

627
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,320
中文字幕
as you tackle your final projects, depending on the nature.

628
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,900
中文字幕
And if you take another class, or CS50 beyond this winter, or you experience

629
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,000
中文字幕
these things yourselves, but we thought we'd at least give you

630
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,560
中文字幕
some links in today's slides, so that you

631
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,260
中文字幕
have something to tinker with over Thanksgiving, or winter break,

632
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,770
中文字幕
or beyond.

633
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,420
中文字幕
So CS50 IDE is meant to be representative of a very

634
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,720
中文字幕
common programming environment.

635
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,420
中文字幕
It happens to be web based, it happens to be in our domain name.

636
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,210
中文字幕
But this idea of having a file browser of some sort,

637
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,700
中文字幕
and tabs where you write code, and a terminal window

638
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,550
中文字幕
with which you interact, incredibly, incredibly, common,

639
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,400
中文字幕
whether it's in the cloud, or more commonly for real world

640
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,460
中文字幕
software developers on your own Mac or your PC.

641
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,180
中文字幕
Frankly, some years from now, this will probably be the way it is, none of us

642
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,360
中文字幕
use our Mac, PCs per se, everything probably is remotely.

643
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,070
中文字幕
So odds are, at some point in the future, we'll come full circle.

644
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,270
中文字幕
But for now, it's quite common to replicate this kind

645
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,170
中文字幕
of setup on your own Mac or PC.

646
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,380
中文字幕
So how do you go about having a command line, which hopefully you've gleaned,

647
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,900
中文字幕
while frustrating, is more powerful than only having

648
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,210
中文字幕
menus and icons available to you that someone else,

649
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,670
中文字幕
like a company, like Microsoft or Apple has given you.

650
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,570
中文字幕
Well, in both Macs and PCs, can you install the same tools

651
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,300
中文字幕
that we used this semester, Clang, and Make,

652
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,870
中文字幕
and you get CD, and LS, and [? Miktor, ?] and all of those commands

653
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,190
中文字幕
on both Mac OS or Windows.

654
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,840
中文字幕
And the starting points can be here.

655
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,930
中文字幕
Both of those provide their own sort of terminal windows, and the software

656
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,790
中文字幕
therein.

657
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,930
中文字幕
You can just install via those two starting points.

658
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,730
中文字幕
Now what about Git?

659
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,800
中文字幕
You've seen or heard about Git, even though we

660
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,770
中文字幕
don't use it hands on in the class.

661
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,690
中文字幕
Odds are you will use this in higher level CS courses, if you take it.

662
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,630
中文字幕
It's one of the most popular programs with which

663
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,510
中文字幕
to save versions of your software.

664
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,430
中文字幕
Now you may have noticed the CS50 IDE does this automatically for you.

665
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,800
中文字幕
You can go to File, Revision History, and you can kind of

666
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,880
中文字幕
go back and forth in time.

667
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,610
中文字幕
And that's great and wonderfully useful, but it doesn't really lend itself

668
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,090
中文字幕
to collaborating with others.

669
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,870
中文字幕
And so, if you're working with partners for the final project,

670
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,950
中文字幕
in the simplest form, you can just have one of you

671
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,250
中文字幕
share your CS50 IDE with the other user names.

672
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,050
中文字幕
And you'll all just share the same account.

673
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,010
中文字幕
And that's fine.

674
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,970
中文字幕
But it gets a little annoying and complicated

675
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,850
中文字幕
if you're both trying to edit the same files,

676
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,810
中文字幕
you're not necessarily talking to one another, or you're in different rooms.

677
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,020
中文字幕
Like, at some point you want to have good workflows.

678
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,390
中文字幕
And so via this URL here, does Brian introduce you to Git, a command line

679
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,540
中文字幕
tool that's super, super, super popular these days, that lets

680
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,190
中文字幕
you save versions of your code.

681
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,150
中文字幕
So you no longer call it Mario 1.C, and Mario 2.C,

682
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,790
中文字幕
and Mario 3 AM.C and the like.

683
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,770
中文字幕
You actually call it Mario.C.

684
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,800
中文字幕
But you let Git take care of time-stamping it and versioning it

685
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,460
中文字幕
for you.

686
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,710
中文字幕
And Git allows you to share your code in the cloud.

687
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,160
中文字幕
What we use GitHub for is for, of course, submissions, and such,

688
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,060
中文字幕
and for commenting.

689
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,980
中文字幕
But more generally, it's used for just storing

690
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,720
中文字幕
code and sharing with other people.

691
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,730
中文字幕
So what you'll do with Git is literally Git

692
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,570
中文字幕
push it to a service like a GitHub, or GitLabs, or others.

693
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,850
中文字幕
Where someone else can then Git pull it onto their own Mac or PC.

694
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,400
中文字幕
And, therefore, you're sharing files.

695
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,940
中文字幕
You don't email.

696
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,230
中文字幕
You don't Dropbox, or the like.

697
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,210
中文字幕
You actually use a standardized software tool.

698
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,800
中文字幕
You can install it via these instructions

699
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,270
中文字幕
here, if you don't have it already.

700
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,260
中文字幕
And more usefully too, can you sign up for free repositories

701
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,060
中文字幕
GitHub.com, you already have an account.

702
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,400
中文字幕
Since you have a student ID, you can go to this URL

703
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,370
中文字幕
here and tell them you're a student at Harvard, or Yale, or beyond.

704
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,040
中文字幕
And then say, can I please have free private repos,

705
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,620
中文字幕
so you can keep your own personal or school projects private,

706
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,720
中文字幕
without needing access to CS50's own organization.

707
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,130
中文字幕
So what do you write code in?

708
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,980
中文字幕
So, there's bunches of editors these days.

709
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,570
中文字幕
Among the most popular is a tools that's called

710
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,700
中文字幕
Atom, which is an open source text editor that

711
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,030
中文字幕
has lots and lots of plug-ins.

712
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,080
中文字幕
This is like the tabbed windows for writing code.

713
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,490
中文字幕
It does syntax, highlighting, and so much more,

714
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,190
中文字幕
so that your code is easy to edit, and it looks pretty wild

715
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,740
中文字幕
you're working on it, and just makes life pretty easy.

716
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,480
中文字幕
Also super popular these days is VS Code or Visual Studio Code.

717
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,360
中文字幕
They are functionally pretty much equivalent.

718
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,940
中文字幕
You can ask your teaching fellows or friends which you prefer,

719
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,070
中文字幕
or just try them both.

720
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,350
中文字幕
They are free, and there's dozens of other options.

721
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,040
中文字幕
These two just currently have a lot of momentum in industry.

722
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,760
中文字幕
Within the terminal window, though, is what a lot of CS students would use,

723
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,660
中文字幕
something called Vim.

724
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,460
中文字幕
And there's alternatives there, called [? Emax ?] and a few others.

725
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,390
中文字幕
But Vim is actually what I grew up on, and still to this day tend to use.

726
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,380
中文字幕
I tend not to use a GUI.

727
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,870
中文字幕
I just use a bigger terminal window with lots and lots of code inside of it.

728
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,750
中文字幕
And Vim is more of a command line tool, where

729
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,630
中文字幕
you have to memorize keyboard shortcuts more so,

730
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,670
中文字幕
but it's also more powerful in the same way

731
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,840
中文字幕
a terminal window tends to be as well.

732
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,120
中文字幕
So whatever you are most comfortable with is fine.

733
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,870
中文字幕
So suppose you want to post a website, like your own personal home

734
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,930
中文字幕
page, your resume, an artistic portfolio, or whatnot,

735
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,100
中文字幕
where do you even begin?

736
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,370
中文字幕
You can certainly make it on your Mac or PC in an HTML file,

737
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,210
中文字幕
but no one in the world can access it.

738
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,140
中文字幕
You can put it in CS50 IDE, but that goes

739
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,060
中文字幕
to sleep eventually, when you're not using it,

740
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,750
中文字幕
which makes it hard for people on the internet to visited at any hour.

741
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,150
中文字幕
But fortunately, there's so many free services out there,

742
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,950
中文字幕
at least if you have modest usage.

743
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,270
中文字幕
If you're trying to build a business, odds

744
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,060
中文字幕
are you're going to pay someone for the bandwidth, and the support,

745
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,640
中文字幕
and so forth.

746
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,880
中文字幕
But if you just have a home page, where you're getting dozens, hundreds, maybe

747
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,790
中文字幕
low thousands of visits, which is probably

748
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,800
中文字幕
likely the case for personal sites, you can

749
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,640
中文字幕
use something called GitHub Pages, a free service where you store your HTML

750
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,430
中文字幕
files, JavaScript, and CSS on GitHub.com,

751
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,720
中文字幕
and they host it for you for free.

752
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,280
中文字幕
Netlify is another free one too, and dot, dot, dot,

753
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,520
中文字幕
you can Google ad nauseam and find any number of free such services.

754
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,600
中文字幕
These just tend to be two popular ones with which I too am familiar.

755
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,040
中文字幕
Hosting a web app, so not a static website, but something more dynamic,

756
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,840
中文字幕
we'll have instructions that we'll circulate for this final project

757
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,750
中文字幕
as well, so that you can sort of graduate from CS50 IDE

758
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,120
中文字幕
and run your final project, or your website,

759
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,290
中文字幕
or your student group's tool, or your startup's website

760
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,580
中文字幕
on a third-party service.

761
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,390
中文字幕
Heroku tends to be very popular.

762
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,940
中文字幕
They too have a free tier of service.

763
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,640
中文字幕
So long as your website's not being hammered by lots and lots of users,

764
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,400
中文字幕
you can use it for free.

765
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,270
中文字幕
You get free access to a database, something called Post [? Gress, ?]

766
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,130
中文字幕
which we alluded to earlier in the semester,

767
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,020
中文字幕
using the same data types we discussed.

768
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,500
中文字幕
Wix is another common one too, that very recently launched support for code, not

769
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,030
中文字幕
just static web sites too.

770
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,530
中文字幕
So these are starting points.

771
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,050
中文字幕
But certainly use Google or the like to find other options as well.

772
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,380
中文字幕
Then there's infrastructure, as a service, so to speak.

773
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,680
中文字幕
There's some bigger fish out there, Amazon, and Microsoft, and Google,

774
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,000
中文字幕
that have cloud-based services.

775
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,220
中文字幕
The learning curve tends to be a little higher, frankly.

776
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,860
中文字幕
So I would encourage you to maybe start with the previous examples, which

777
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,780
中文字幕
are businesses built on top of these layers.

778
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,390
中文字幕
But if you're interested, absolutely sign up

779
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,310
中文字幕
as a student for any number of these services,

780
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,170
中文字幕
and they tend to give you lots of financial credits,

781
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,410
中文字幕
so you can just try things for free, for like a month,

782
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,730
中文字幕
or a year, or whatnot to get your feet wet.

783
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,010
中文字幕
It's a wonderfully free world when you're just

784
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,830
中文字幕
getting started in this space.

785
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,170
中文字幕
And then more general advice.

786
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:56,700
中文字幕
Read lots.

787
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,350
中文字幕
And I'm sure if you ask the TFs and CAs, you'll

788
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,810
中文字幕
get an even longer list of sites.

789
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,730
中文字幕
But these tend to be the kinds of sites I go to if I just kind of want

790
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,530
中文字幕
to stay in the loop on things.

791
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,580
中文字幕
Subscribing to various sub-Reddits, so to speak,

792
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,200
中文字幕
is compelling, where information, news, conversations, just get pushed at you.

793
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,330
中文字幕
And honestly, whenever I'm asked how I kind of stay

794
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,120
中文字幕
in touch with certain things, I hear things from friends,

795
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,490
中文字幕
I get emails about technologies, I get curious, and so I poke around.

796
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,540
中文字幕
And these tend to be the places that I might go, and a lot of tech people

797
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,300
中文字幕
go, to talk about new trends and technologies.

798
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,600
中文字幕
Or if you're trying to vet something, should I use x or should I use y,

799
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,650
中文字幕
don't just use Google.

800
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,760
中文字幕
Check out those websites as well.

801
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,680
中文字幕
And then CS50, if you'd like to stay in touch.

802
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,910
中文字幕
So CS50, not so much here on campus, but for students around the world,

803
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,460
中文字幕
maintains a number of online communities, all of which

804
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,300
中文字幕
you're welcome to partake in, answering questions, or asking questions,

805
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,260
中文字幕
or the like.

806
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,130
中文字幕
And those are just the few of the current ones now.

807
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:53,890
中文字幕
Any questions on any or all of those past or future steps?

808
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,400
中文字幕
Anything at all?

809
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,140
中文字幕
No?

810
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,180
中文字幕
All right.

811
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,500
中文字幕
OK, so we'll adjourn in just a little bit

812
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,560
中文字幕
time for our tradition of cake downstairs in the pub.

813
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,750
中文字幕
But we also have one other tradition, especially now

814
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,130
中文字幕
that you have some 10 weeks of experience behind you.

815
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,010
中文字幕
For all intents and purposes, you are all now

816
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:14,010
中文字幕
qualified as CS50 staff, because, indeed, at the end of the day,

817
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,820
中文字幕
most of CS50 staff are recent alumni of the course themselves,

818
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,300
中文字幕
sophomores, juniors, seniors, recent graduates, students online who

819
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,960
中文字幕
have taken this class, maybe taken another class in the spring or beyond,

820
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,430
中文字幕
and then joined us as staff.

821
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,670
中文字幕
So realize that even if you're not feeling more comfortable yet,

822
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,400
中文字幕
or most comfortable, nor are most of the staff,

823
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,500
中文字幕
and myself included, with a lot of these things.

824
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,590
中文字幕
And so long as you stay one step ahead and you know the kinds of resources

825
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,100
中文字幕
to turn to, this is what it really is about when learning in this world.

826
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,880
中文字幕
And in fact, a very common mindset, I do know, in the class,

827
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,200
中文字幕
in the problem sets, in the quiz, is wait a minute,

828
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,420
中文字幕
you didn't teach us this.

829
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,600
中文字幕
And that, odds are, was quite true quite often.

830
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,620
中文字幕
And I don't just mean to be rationalizing it.

831
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,270
中文字幕
That was very much by design.

832
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,320
中文字幕
In the real world, that's exactly the emotion you're hopefully going to feel,

833
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,300
中文字幕
or realistically going to feel quite often.

834
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,940
中文字幕
And we truly do hope that among the tools you've gotten,

835
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,570
中文字幕
training wheels and beyond, is to know where to have the right instincts now

836
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,740
中文字幕
with how to bootstrap yourself, so to speak, and solve problems, and learn

837
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,630
中文字幕
things on your own.

838
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:18,560
中文字幕
But we thought we would, in conclusion put that to the test.

839
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,930
中文字幕
And I think for this, we need--

840
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,750
中文字幕
let's see, we have a bunch of chairs up here, four student volunteers,

841
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,550
中文字幕
for about to be--

842
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,190
中文字幕
four about to be alumni volunteers.

843
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,960
中文字幕
OK, over here in the front, yeah, come on down.

844
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,550
中文字幕
Over here, in the front, and three.

845
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,930
中文字幕
And let me try to see about four, over here, come on down.

846
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,360
中文字幕
All right four, you have four?

847
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,680
中文字幕
Colton's going to join us.

848
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,940
中文字幕
Uh-oh, OK, we'll take five, that's fine, but you gotta bring a chair.

849
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,730
中文字幕
We'll find a chair somewhere.

850
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,330
中文字幕
Come on down.

851
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:51,590
中文字幕
And now I need four staff volunteers, if we could.

852
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,000
中文字幕
Who on the staff might--

853
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,430
中文字幕
Oh, yes, ma'am come on up.

854
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,050
中文字幕
Athena has volunteered.

855
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,340
中文字幕
Oh, Erin, would you like to--

856
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,940
中文字幕
oh, come up.

857
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,180
中文字幕
Yeah, who?

858
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,040
中文字幕
OK, yeah, come on up, Robert.

859
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,670
中文字幕
OK, thank you so much for volunteering.

860
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,600
中文字幕
OK, so-- but the catch is, we need the staff on their own team.

861
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,740
中文字幕
So let's put the students here, because you need--

862
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,240
中文字幕
that's OK.

863
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,240
中文字幕
Could you guys go over here?

864
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,030
中文字幕
OK, all five of you-- we have our student team over here.

865
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,160
中文字幕
And we'll find you one more chair in just a moment.

866
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,700
中文字幕
Staff, go ahead and take a seat here.

867
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,200
中文字幕
You each have a piece of paper, a pen, and a microphone.

868
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,040
中文字幕
And why don't we go ahead, as we get ready to go here--

869
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,680
中文字幕
do you want to each just say hello and introduce yourself?

870
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,180
中文字幕
ERIN: Hello.

871
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,760
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: Well, you can tell them.

872
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,430
中文字幕
ERIN: Hello, I'm Erin, one of the course preceptors.

873
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,560
中文字幕
ISAAC: I'm Isaac, I'm a TF.

874
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,070
中文字幕
ROBERT: I'm Robert, I'm a CA.

875
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,950
中文字幕
ATHENA: And I'm Athena, I'm a TF.

876
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,240
中文字幕
ANDREA: Hi, I'm Andrea, I'm an alumni, soon.

877
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,300
中文字幕
AVIVA: Hi, I'm Aviva, me too.

878
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,130
中文字幕
JONATHAN: I'm Jonathan.

879
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,610
中文字幕
APRIL: April.

880
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,590
中文字幕
ERIC: I'm Eric.

881
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,940
中文字幕
COLTON: Hi, I Colton, I'm a technologist.

882
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,990
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: All right, so what are we all doing up here, you might wonder.

883
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,710
中文字幕
Well, we have this tradition of using all of those questions

884
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,090
中文字幕
that you offered for the quiz, recall in problem set seven, just a couple

885
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,010
中文字幕
of weeks ago, as refreshers.

886
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,770
中文字幕
Now mind you, there is quite the difference between, I think,

887
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,370
中文字幕
a lot of the questions you offered up at suggestions for quiz questions.

888
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,890
中文字幕
Many of them were like, what is two in binary,

889
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,610
中文字幕
or maybe what is three in binary.

890
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,810
中文字幕
And so, that was great.

891
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,970
中文字幕
But we were looking for a little harder questions.

892
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,170
中文字幕
And we get some of those too.

893
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,350
中文字幕
And so Colton kindly went through the thousands

894
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,230
中文字幕
of questions that were submitted just a couple of weeks

895
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,370
中文字幕
ago, to pluck out some of the most serious, some of the most playful ones.

896
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,730
中文字幕
And I have here them clustered into categories,

897
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,720
中文字幕
because we have this tradition of playing our own version, staff

898
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,720
中文字幕
versus students, of Jeopardy.

899
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,450
中文字幕
Now because you all wrote the questions in the form of questions,

900
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,110
中文字幕
I'm going to read them in the form of questions and not answers.

901
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,840
中文字幕
So it's more of a quiz show, if we could, staff versus students.

902
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,600
中文字幕
The first person to raise their hand, we'll call on first.

903
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,250
中文字幕
We don't have buzzer technology here.

904
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,880
中文字幕
Colton will be our judge, if you don't mind being the judge.

905
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,050
中文字幕
And we'll do just a few rounds of single and double,

906
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,270
中文字幕
and on Final Jeopardy, followed by cake.

907
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,420
中文字幕
So in a moment, we'll show you the categories,

908
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,820
中文字幕
and begin asking the questions.

909
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,020
中文字幕
Do you have any questions of your own?

910
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,730
中文字幕
STUDENT: Are we answering with questions?

911
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,510
中文字幕

1115
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,160

We have time for one more question before we move on to Final Jeopardy.

1116

中文字幕

1123
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,640
中文字幕
What do you call the situation when a structure

1124
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,560
中文字幕
refers to itself in its definition?

1125
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,050
中文字幕
Students?

1126
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:44,990

1128
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:55,980

OK, so we now go into our last question of CS50 of staff versus students.

1129
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,890
中文字幕
Staff have 4,000, students have 6,200.

1130
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,700
中文字幕
You're about to be told the Final Jeopardy category, at which point

1131
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,910
中文字幕
each team needs to commit in writing, on the sheet of paper in front of them,

1132
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:10,050
中文字幕
with the CS50 pen in front of them, to a dollar amount,

1133
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:13,390
中文字幕
keeping in mind that you will either gain or lose this amount.

1134
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,940
中文字幕
All right, go ahead and choose your-- oh,

1135
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:27,380
中文字幕
here we go, the category for Final Jeopardy is going to be Buggy.

1136
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,100
中文字幕
Buggy will be your category.

1137
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,990
中文字幕
Any dollar amount.

1138
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,520
中文字幕
Any dollar amount.

1139
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:48,320
中文字幕
OK, so, so, here we go.

1140
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:54,040
中文字幕
The question is, they've all committed to a dollar amount.

1141
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,550
中文字幕
OK, I feel like you can hedge your bets there.

1142
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:02,470
中文字幕
All right, so here we go, Final Jeopardy, Buggy is the category.

1143
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:16,980
中文字幕
In which state, besides Massachusetts, does Google sometimes think we reside?

1144
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:49,440
中文字幕
[MUSIC PLAYING - "JEOPARDY THEME SONG"]

1145
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,170
中文字幕
All right.

1146
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:56,370
中文字幕
So, I think staff were not in the lead, or not in the lead,

1147
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,150
中文字幕
so we start with you.

1148
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:01,900
中文字幕
Staff, first of all, how much did you wager?

1149
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,250
中文字幕
OK, depending, I think, on how the question went,

1150
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,380
中文字幕
they wagered either $4,000 or $40, apparently.

1151
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,660
中文字幕
STAFF: [INAUDIBLE]

1152
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,630
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: $40, will go with 4,000.

1153
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,030
中文字幕
And what was your answer?

1154
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,820
中文字幕
STAFF: We picked Kansas.

1155
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,240
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: Kansas, interesting.

1156
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,820
中文字幕
Now, students, how much did you wager?

1157
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,450
中文字幕
STUDENT: 2,000.

1158
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,070
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: 2,000.

1159
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:25,000
中文字幕
and what was your answer?

1160
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,620
中文字幕
STUDENT: Also Kansas.

1161
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,750
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: And also Kansas.

1162
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,800
中文字幕
So 2,000 would bring you to 8,200.

1163
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,750
中文字幕
4,000 would bring you to 8,000.

1164
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,770
中文字幕
So if you're both right, students you might have clinched it.

1165
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,730
中文字幕
Does the audience remember where Google thought

1166
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,310
中文字幕
we were a few weeks ago, despite the fact that I

1167
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:46,700
中文字幕
misstated where Google thinks we were?

1168
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:51,430
中文字幕
Oklahoma was my incorrect answer, it turns out.

1169
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:52,960
中文字幕
Wyoming, also incorrect.

1170
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,940
中文字幕
But we can do sort of binary search in that area.

1171
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,770
中文字幕
Anyone at all?

1172
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,060
中文字幕
SPEAKER 1: It is, in fact, Kansas.

1173
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:05,810
中文字幕
So congratulations to the students' team.

1174
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,870
