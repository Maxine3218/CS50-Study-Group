## 00:42:45,660 三声猫叫

If you've heard of the expression gigahertz, that's a unit of measure, and if your computer has a one gigahertz CPU, central processing unit, or brain, that means it can literally do like a billion things per second. It can certainly start three sounds super fast. And if they're effectively all happening one after the other before the sound even finishes, you're just hearing one net effect.

> And if they're effectively all happening one after the other before the sound even finishes

`they` 指代的是声音？还是发声这个指令过程？（讨论的时候认为是指代声音）

> you're just hearing one net effect.

`one net effect` net result/effect 的意思是 the final result or effect of something。在本句话中 `one net effect` 可以被翻译为“最终音效”。

## 00:48:24,825 难以穷尽

Using unary, my old school hashmark approach, I can count to five on this hand. Using binary, I claimed I could count to 31 on this hand. But it's still finite. I cannot count to infinity on this hand because I only have five fingers. Similarly does a computer only have so many transistors or so many bytes or bits of memory, and at some point, the programmer has to think about what is he or she going to do when the user wants to count so high that you can't physically fit it anymore. You have to give up like this and say something semi accurately or you have to handle that issue in some other way.

`old school` 老套

`unary`一进制

## 存储有限

But what happens here? Well, because computers, at the end of the day, are just storing information digitally-- but that information digitally has to be physically stored using electricity, using these lower level switches called transistors. At the end of the day, my phone, my laptop, whatever device in question only has a finite amount of those things.

> At the end of the day, my phone, my laptop, whatever device in question only has a finite amount of those things.

`digitally` 和  `digitally` 都是副词，该如何处理。

`at the end of the day` 这个词组字面上是时间的最终，但这个词组可以用来引导结论，take everything into consideration。在本句中可以翻译为：说到底、到头来。

`whatever device in question` 其中 `in question` 可以理解为 being considered，这句话就是说，除了前面说的这些，任何跟有类似问题的设备。
